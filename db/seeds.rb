    I can feel all the muscles in my face tightening around my eyes. I resisted harder than ever. Now I can barely see as I post this to you.

  She clocked out of her office and rushed to her moped in the parking lot. She tied her hair into a bun, wore a helmet, tucked the loose end of her saree into her waist, and drove away. A green-coloured saree with an off-white coloured blouse was the dress code at her workplace. Driving on an empty road with trees on either side, she navigated all the distractions and carefully contemplated her next steps to win the daily evening game at home.

"It isn't a win until he agrees. We are totally in the lead, but who knows, he might try to pull a sneaky move. I am sure he wouldn't have any planned move, and we shouldn't be too competitive and lose ideas to him like we did with the 'labelling the sock' argument. Let's play dumb and let him figure out his moves. So you will be playing a naive housewife but don't be too naive to fall into his trap. I also think we should add more depth to the character."

She loosened her hand on the accelerator, drifted into the side lane, and drove slowly, pondering over it.

"Remember that housewife from our recent bank visit? Despite her documents being perfect, the bank people kept her waiting and raised doubts about her documents, expecting a commission. But she was kind, pleasing, and patient. She never lost her temper arguing about her rights but spent her waiting time as if she owned all the time in the world, helping old people with their forms. Finally, it was the bank people who were moved down to her and processed her loan. Let's play her. I think perseverance with kindness and a pleasing attitude would add a little depth to the character."

She moved back, tilted her head a bit, and got a look at herself in the moped's rearview mirror with a smile of joy. A cool breeze brushed her cheek, broadening the smile on her face and amplifying her delight. All the excitement she had held at higher altitudes until then flew in, blinded her restraint and overwhelmed her to anticipate the ideas to act on after winning.

"The photograph should suggest him waiting at a bus stop with all public transport called for a protest. His rest face photograph could be used to replace all the numbers on the clock. Should I click a joyful face of his in an urban landscape or a gloomy face of his in a small town landscape?" Her vehicle bounced over a speed bump a few streets from his office building, causing a sudden jolt that dampened her excitement and set her ideas aside.

"I have a question," the character she designed asked innocently. "How is my character going to help you achieve victory? We are not suggesting anything through my character related to our side of the argument: living experience in bigger cities is better than in a small town."

"That part of the argument is over if you remember. Oh! you wouldn't possibly know it since you were just created. I’ve designed a few other characters and used them to address that issue, and we’ve successfully proven that living experience in bigger cities is better. It’s just that he couldn’t accept the defeat," she explained to her character as she neared his office.

She parked her vehicle in the visitor's parking area, which was filled with women waiting for their fathers, brothers, or husbands to pick them up. Gathering her excitement, she walked toward the security guard. He was occupied with ensuring the safety of the women but smiled as she approached him.

"Sir said he might take some time."

"Is the manager around?"

"Yes, they're in a meeting. He asked you to go ahead."

"Never mind, I'll wait."

She walked back to her moped and waited with the other women. Her character-in-training said, "This is our chance. We should go home and prepare his favourite snack before he arrives."

"That's an unexpectedly good idea," she agreed, tying her hair into a bun.

"Weren’t we supposed to be kind?" the character asked.

"Yes, of course we are."

"Then, let’s leave the moped for him and take the bus."

"You’re not supposed to cause me pain. You’re getting too into character, but anyway..."

"You know what, since you’ve decided to sacrifice the moped, he’ll be considering ways to reciprocate. Let’s steer his thoughts so that we come out on top."

"But how?"

"Let’s write a note asking if we should pack our bags and pass it to him along with the keys."

"Isn’t that a bit too persuasive?"

"I’m being strategic and hinting at what I want in return. It’s still up to him to decide."

"If I get his photo framed on the wall, the credit will go to you."

"You are my creator who designed me."

She wrote a note that read, "Shall I pack our bags?" and handed it to the security guard along with the moped's key. "Please pass these to him, and don’t read it. Also, let him know that I took the bus."

She slipped the ticket into one compartment filled with similar tickets and the coins into another. Then she put on her headphones, plugged the jack into her Walkman, flipped the cassette, and tuned into "A Boy Named Sue" by Johnny Cash. On the bus, she sat by the window, lost in the music, and gazed out at the streets with a serene smile.

The same cassette was being played. Changed into her pyjamas, she was occupied preparing his favourite snack. This time, the music came from the tape recorder and the large speakers. The speakers were in the four corners of the main hall's wall, and the tape recorder rested on the centre table. The wall was filled with portraits of them. They included a photograph of two arms stretched out and giving a fist pump, both arms wearing toilet paper rolls like bangles, with the toilet paper rolled over from one arm and rolled under from the other; a photograph of him crouched inside a fridge holding ketchup bottles in his hands; and a photograph of her, tired from labelling socks with a thread and needle, with a pile of socks in front of her to be labelled, among many others.
The same cassette played on as she changed into her pyjamas and focused on preparing his favourite snack. This time, the music came from the tape recorder and large speakers. The speakers were positioned in the four corners of the main hall, and the tape recorder rested on the centre table. The walls were adorned with portraits of them. Among the photographs were two arms stretched out and giving a fist pump, both arms wearing toilet paper rolls like bangles—one roll wrapped from above and the other from below; another of him crouched inside a fridge, holding ketchup bottles; and a tired image of her holding a sock labelled "L," surrounded by a pile of socks yet to be labelled, with a thread and needle in the other hand.

She sang along, adjusting her pitch until the highs and lows were balanced and the sound was pleasing. Once she achieved the right tone, she patted herself on the back.

"Yes! Well done, baby. You deserve a coffee for this. That’s the voice we need. It’s going to melt him like ice cream, and we’re going to frame him today."

She made her a coffee, picked up the current read from the rack, and walked out to the balcony. She noticed that her balcony garden was dry and in need of water. She paused as the coffee cup neared her lips.

"You need some patience training too. Remember, you’re a woman who can read a book while having your coffee at a cool temperature, but you can't focus on your book if you’re distracted by the thought of not watering the plants."

She sipped the coffee and found it pleasantly hot enough to continue reading. She turned to the bookmarked page and discovered a note which read, "I hope my argument from last night has convinced you." Instinctively, the newly designed character exclaimed in a distorted voice, "I bet! He has similar expectations too!"

“You’re breaking your tone and pitch. Don’t panic! You have a job ahead of you tonight!” Clearing her pitch, the pleasing voice suggested, “Ohh! Alright, let’s use the snack as an element of surprise.”

She agreed, saying, “That can surely help, but I don’t know how at this moment.”

She paused and resumed her reading several times, reassuring the pleasing character, who had turned nervous, that their note would have a similar effect on him.

The knock on the door broke her perpetual thoughts. She got up, placed the book back in the rack, ensuring it looked like it had never been opened, and then answered the door. He entered, his eyes immediately scanning the balcony, only to find a lone coffee cup, much to his dismay. She took his bag, waited for him to hand over the lunch box hanging from his other shoulder, and watched his face closely for any sign of disappointment, which briefly flashed before quickly fading away.

"Hello, sir, good evening! How was your day? Would you like anything?" she asked.

"The man was caught off guard by the overwhelming and unexpected hospitality but played along. 'Good evening! It was a great day, thanks for asking. Maybe a glass of water.'"

She walked into the kitchen to fetch water. "What were you doing? I thought we had found the balance. Why were you exaggerating? And why did you have to use 'sir'?"

"Did I overdo it?" asked the pleasing voice, its pitch rising.

"I’m sorry," the pleasing voice apologized, sounding distressed.

Astonished by the sensitivity of the character she designed, she said, "Nah! Nah! Nah! You did a great job. It’s always a good idea to offer your husband some water."

"Thank you!" the pleasing voice responded, regaining its balanced tone.

"Perfect! That’s the tuned voice... stick to it. But you know what? You should be a bit stronger."

She waited for him to move his shoes to the rack and then handed him the glass of water. As he drank, she fidgeted impatiently, eager to hear his thoughts. She wasn’t prepared for disappointment. With her eyes tightly shut, she peeked out through one eye and asked, "Shall I pack the bags?"

He tried to keep his soiled hands from touching his mouth, which was agape in surprise. "I thought my words from last night had convinced you."

"Shall I fetch more water?" she asked, ignoring his words as if he hadn’t spoken.

"I'm good, thank you."

"You were saying something?" she prompted.

"I assumed I convinced you last night."

"About last night... your words put me to sleep. My apologies for saying that."

Unable to handle the truth delivered in such a pleasing tone, the man fell silent.

"I’ve prepared your favourite snack, so please tidy up."

She walked away with the glass, and the pleasing voice was praised all the way. "Timely move! Just when he became speechless, you presented him with the surprise. Now we’re not encouraging anything from last night."
"I’m upset; he didn’t thank us for leaving the moped for him," the pleasing voice said, struggling to maintain the tone.

"Don't show it. He owes us one, which gives us the advantage to influence him about packing the bags."

He made sure she went inside and then stealthily approached the book rack. He picked up her current read and noticed that the bookmark and the note he had left were six pages apart. He pulled out a small note from his shirt pocket and checked the page number he had noted when placing the note. Neither the bookmark nor the note was on the correct page. A smile briefly flashed across his face before disappearing as he heard her approaching. He quickly returned the book to its place and went into his room.

He gathered the snack into two bowls, offered one to her, and sat opposite her on the balcony. After taking a spoonful of the snack and being blown away by the taste, he reached into his pocket and pulled out two brightly coloured slips. "I got movie tickets for tonight," he said.

She turned away uncharacteristically as she scooped up the snack with her spoon. "Come on, movies? You know they're as stale as my life in this small town."

"We agreed not to show our anger," she reminded the character with a pleasing voice, speaking softly.

"It wasn’t rude; I said it very politely," the pleasing voice defended.

"Yes, but you were angry and made our point clear."

"Did I?"

"Yes, indeed! 'Stale as my life in this small town,'" she pointed out to the character. "Speak in a soft tone, and don’t let those thou...ggts..."

He interrupted her, having recovered from the disconcerting experience of her reaction to his planned surprise. "You like adventures; this is an adventure film about four teens."

"I sure do like them, but not anymore," her tone had softened.

"This movie will be close to your childhood favourite author, Enid Blyton."

"I doubt eeet..." she began cautiously, realizing her earlier tone might have sounded rude, "will it offer anything new?"

"It will, I’m sure it will, because it’s based on a true story."

"What truth did the teens uncover?"

"Caught you! Wee...hoo! That’s something to be watched in the movie."

"You said it’s a true story? The facts must already be out there."

"Yes! Why not save your curiosity for the cinema?"

She may not have realized how intently she was looking into his eyes, demanding an answer, but he noticed.

"Well... well... I know you can’t resist—four teens found a nameless manuscript on a train while returning from their vacation. They embark on an adventure to find its rightful author."

"This story doesn’t seem like it would become famous. How did the makers even find out about it?" Before he could answer, she interjected, "Did they plaster pamphlets everywhere to get attention?"

He struggled to withhold giving her any credit for that guess, but his head involuntarily nodded, with his lower lip jutting out in amazement. "Yes! Someone published a news article covering it, titled 'It's Unpublished Yet!'"

"You see... how predictable it is. That could bore me. I feel the same about our lives—life here is predictable and boring. Nothing new or exciting ever happens, and everything remains static. That’s why moving to a bigger city is so appealing."

"He stared blankly at her, processing what she said, and broke the silence. 'I don’t see how predictability in movies relates to life in a small town.'"

“It is. My life here is predictable and boring, just like a movie that is too predictable.”

“No, come on, that doesn’t make sense. Think about nostalgia. It can remind you of the days when you visited your grandmother, crossing the streams with your 'Famous Five' book in your bag.”

“Ahh, nostalgia. That’s all movies and small towns can ever offer. It’s so overrated and keeps me occupied, making me dwell on what I did this day last week, last year, and soon, in the future, I’ll be reminiscing about what I did on this day a year ago, telling myself I was having the very same thought. It feels like I’m just ageing with the same memories. Nostalgia has a way of making me forget about the surprises I’m missing out on in bigger cities. I’m missing them.”

This made him perplexed. "I see some great ideas developing in your statement, but only a part of it made sense to me. I see great potential in your point"

"You like my argument," she said excitedly.

"Yes, but it seems like it's still in its early stages."

Staring at him, she tried to look at her idea sharply. "You know what? Let's go to the movies. I think I can refine it and make it clearer by the time the movie is over."

"Sure, I want to listen to it. I like listening to you."

Both of them joined in the kitchen to cook dinner. He chopped the vegetables while she consulted the recipe guide, waiting for the pan to heat up. After setting the guide aside, she checked the pan with her palm and determined it needed a little more time.

“How did you like that character? Did she annoy you?” she chuckled.

“I wish she had just annoyed me; she actually scared me. She was so pleasing and had a lot of expectations. I felt like she was demanding politeness, and I could sense her anger simmering beneath the surface. I was playing a sophisticated guy with deep pockets, so getting angry wasn’t an option. I was provoked, but I don’t think my character knew how to be angry and sound sweet at the same time. I think tolerance was the best choice for my character.”

"True! I couldn't agree more. Her approach was provocative, and the sad part is, she didn't even realize it. Even if she had, she wouldn't have admitted it. She was blinded by her conviction, thinking she was doing the right thing. She must have given you a hell of a ride."

"Yes, she did! But what did my character come across as?"

"Did you have anything in mind about your character apart from his tolerance? I thought the tolerance was impromptu."

"Soon after I realized you had read the note, I trained myself as a sophisticated urban guy with deep pockets, aiming to intimidate, please, and persuade you."

"Are you saying your character persuaded her for the movie?"

"I think he did a pretty good job there. What do you think?"

"Of course he did. These sophisticated people with deep pockets have a knack for intimidating and gaslighting others. Pity the lives of women like my character, married to such men. Sooner or later, they’ll feel very sad realizing that they never had their own wishes or dreams—all were planted by these men. Vulnerability. I thought you were playing a politician—you were diplomatic and had a lot of tolerance most of the time."

He picked up a bitter gourd and spoke into it, waving his hand periodically like a robot imitating a politician. He made exaggerated, animated faces of a contemporary politician. She watched these faces closely, trying to identify who he was mimicking. When she finally recognized the politician, she burst into laughter, and he joined in, halting his act.

They sat around the dining table, thankful their dinner hadn't turned out to be unpalatable. As he took a bite, he mumbled through a mouthful, "I might have to rely on you for tonight's role. I want to decide whether to go ahead with the one I have in mind based on yours."

After chewing and swallowing her food, she responded, "Well, what is it? Honestly, I want to blend two roles, but I’m leaning towards just one. Since you’ve already depended on my naive, pleasing character once, I’d like to hear about yours first."

"Fair enough! I’m thinking of playing a guy who got inspired by crime movies and pulled off a successful bank heist."

"Wow, that guy’s going to champion movies like a true believer. I’m curious how he’ll defend your argument that life in a smaller town is better than in bigger cities."

"Honestly, I have no idea. Since you said you’d argue against movies to make your point, I figured I’d use him as a shield until you wore yourself out."

"Not a bad plan."

He watched her, waiting for a response. She closed her eyes tightly, pressing her fingers against the bridge of her nose as she thought. "Sorry, I got carried away. I don’t think I have any idea how to make that point right now. I might try to break through your wall, but I’m not sure I’ll even make a dent. Anyway, I’m playing a theatre critic in disguise as a dumb girl dressed up for a party. With the movie running for about two hours, I’m hoping this character can pierce through your wall of defence. I’m confident."

"Why would you reveal the disguise? I'm curious."

"The play critic can't always be right. When she's wrong, she’d feel bad, and I don't want her to waste time dealing with those consequences. So, I'd rather let her blame the dumb girl dressed for the pub for the errors. She needs a few trial-and-error opportunities, and the dumb girl is her excuse."

"That's an impressive one. I can already see you framing me there."

"What do you think are the odds?"

It was a midsummer night, and he carried an umbrella with him. They visited an ice cream parlour. He wore jeans and a half-sleeve checkered shirt in a light-coloured palette of white, light orange, and a hint of olive. A black cap sat atop his head, complementing his clean-shaven face with a thick moustache. She wore a flowing black mini A-line dress with a studded sweetheart neckline. Delicate diamond studs, elegant stilettos, and a touch of red lipstick added to her elegance. He opened the door, and the delightful scent that wafted through the parlour couldn't stop him from turning around after noticing that all the tables had been taken. She held his hand and said, 'It's ice cream; it melts. We will find a table soon.'

The waiter approached their table, handed them menus, and walked away to attend to other guests. Without glancing at the menu, he called out, "I’d like to have a vanilla." She, on the other hand, perused the list, reading through the descriptions and studying the colourful pictures of the ice creams.

"Are you stuck between too many options?" he teased.

She didn’t reply. Leaning forward, he asked in a low voice, "Are you looking for an opportunity to forecast?"

"Yes! Indeed I am," she confirmed.

"I’m curious, what’s the idea this time?" he asked.

She took a moment to detach herself from the menu, looking up to meet his eyes. "I’ve selected something, and I believe they won’t have it."

"What is it?" he asked instinctively.

"You’ll see. If it’s not available, then I win," she said confidently.

"And if it is available, then I win," he affirmed.

"Well, I’ll have to try hard. Sometimes it doesn’t rain even when the forecast says it will," she mused.

"Alright, I’m all ears," he said, signalling the waiter to come over. The waiter nodded in acknowledgement.

"But did you decide on what you actually want to have?" he asked.

"Yes, and I’m sure it exists," she laughed.

"So if it doesn’t exist, you would lose?" he teased.

"Technically, I should win because I would have guessed two non-existent things."

"But you intended the second one to exist," he pointed out.

"Yes," she agreed reluctantly. "Alright, I would lose if it didn’t exist."

The waiter approached their table, "One vanilla and one little berry," she announced.

"Sorry, ma’am, the little berry is not available," the waiter informed her.

She wanted to scream in victory but instead glanced down at the menu, then around the parlour, observing couples, families, and elderly duos all enjoying their treats. The lively chatter of their conversations tempered her excitement. She turned to the waiter, who stood by their table with his pen poised, not wanting to draw attention with an outburst, "Add one kaju kismiss," she requested.

After a brief pause, the waiter apologized again. "I’m sorry, madam."

Puzzled, she glanced at him, her earlier excitement mirrored in his face.

"Is it out of stock?" she asked hurriedly.

"Make it two vanilla," she decided quickly.

The waiter walked away with their order. "The weight of excitement just evaporated," she remarked, surprised.

"So did my fear. So, are you going to lose?" he chuckled.

"Well, I won the first one, lost the second... that leaves us at 50-50 again. Now I’ll have to try harder. I should’ve looked around and picked something others were having, or at least vanilla."

The waiter returned with their order, and she inquired, "Why was kaju kismiss not available?"

"People weren’t preferring it these days, and we had instances of large quantities being left over," the waiter explained.

"Oh, thank you," she replied. "Enjoy your ice cream before it melts," the waiter said, greeting them before walking away.

They savoured their ice cream, letting it melt gently in their warm mouths.

Another couple entered the parlour. The man, noticing them, approached their table with a puzzled look on his face, leaving his wife behind. He walked steadily, his expression shifting between curiosity and confusion as he drew closer.

As the stranger approached their table he quickly recognized him, stood up and greeted him with a hug. "I thought it was you, but your hat kept throwing me off," the stranger admitted, relieved.

"Yeah! How have you been?" they exchanged pleasantries and introduced their wives.

They engaged in a lively conversation about their lives. She noticed the stranger's wife seemed uncomfortable, fidgeting with the zip of her handbag. The stranger noticed the umbrella and excitedly asked, "Oh, an umbrella! Which movie have you watched?"

"We haven't yet. We are about to," he replied.

"Do you remember the movie we sneaked off to as kids, and you brought your school umbrella? It was a memorable experience. Ever since you've carried an umbrella for luck," his friend reminisced.

"Yes, those were the good old days," he smiled.

"I always admired your commitment to your superstitions."

Glancing at her, he noticed that their conversation had made the stranger's wife uncomfortable and had also melted his ice cream. They silently agreed to leave the table to them and decided to move on.

"Alright! We should get going. We're running late for the movie. It was nice catching up with you!" they bid farewell and left.

They walked down the street with empty ice cream cups in hand. Tossing them into a public bin at the corner, they crossed the road. She held his hand as they crossed, asking, "Which movie was it? the first one you took an umbrella to?"

"It was an old movie. It wasn't the first time I carried it, but I made it look like a superstition to everyone due to a lack of convincing words. Once, after a movie, it started pouring rain. I had lost myself in the movie, forgetting about exams, homework, games, everything. It was a surreal experience. I wanted to walk into that rain, into the pool of water outside the theatre, but I was stopped. Someday, I want to relive that nostalgia... You see, movies can transport you to another world."

"Wait, I feel like you're patronizing me. That's what movies are supposed to do, but I also think you shouldn't be bored in that world," she teased.

He remained silent, the air filled with a tense silence.

"I'm sorry if I overstepped. Your story just got me into my character," she apologized.

"No worries. We were almost near time to step into our characters," he reassured her.

Pulling out their wristwatches from their pocket and handbag, they wished each other a fun time and entered the theatre compound.

They walked into the theatre compound, bustling with people of all ages. A mother and father were consoling their crying toddler, two siblings were fighting discreetly away from their parents, a group of friends were laughing loudly, another couple held hands just like them, and an old couple tried to organize their belongings. Amidst all the notices on the walls, one particularly caught his attention: "Beware of pickpockets." She moved towards the movie posters to get a closer look.

He warned her, "Be careful, there are pickpockets around."

She turned back and said, "Coming from you, it sounds ironic," and walked towards the posters.

He was the most conscious person in the compound, or at least he tried to be. He quickly began to identify potential robbery targets: the box office, the vehicle parking counter, and the canteen. He forced his thoughts and ideas to formulate plans to rob each of those targets. His meticulous planning was disturbed by people brushing past him. He smiled at them and tried to resume his planning, struggling to pick up where he left off. Eventually, he concluded that robbing any of the three targets would likely result in getting caught. He thought, for a desperate man with robbery as his only way out, he should consider jumping the compound wall from the backside to escape and the box office is the only reward worth the risk of climbing and jumping the tall compound wall.

The movie poster depicted a steam engine running along the countryside, but it emitted yellow pamphlets instead of smoke. A few teens gathered around, trying to figure out what the poster was about. She, without hesitation, meddled in their conversation and said, "This poster is a metaphor to say the teens travelled on trains distributing pamphlets."

She moved to another poster, a silhouette of four teens sitting on top of the train, each on a different compartment, and no two of them looking in the same direction. She felt disappointed that the poster was giving away the main theme.

People started moving inside the theatre hall, and she returned to him. They walked with the crowd towards the entrance. Two men, with physiques like bouncers, stood there checking tickets. Though he had tickets, he successfully walked in without showing them.

"This place deserves a robbery; it would be easy. The robber could simply walk through the gate; he doesn't have to jump the wall. At least then the management will be a bit more stringent in checking tickets. There is no tension or a sense of it while walking through the checkpoint without tickets," he expressed his disappointment.

"These people are just presenting the idea that only people with tickets will be allowed inside. They need not be perfect I think", she replied.

"If that's the case, a notice would have been sufficient. The bouncers are put there for a purpose. They took away all the thrill. That's what we robbers crave for more than the loot."

"Well, nobody is perfect!" she calmed him down.

"Some Like It Hot by Billy Wilder. Look how much thrill the characters in disguises in that movie experience."

"Well, I haven't seen that movie."

"You should. It's fun. I will gift you the VCD."

"Movies are not my taste. They bore me with their predictability."

"I see."

"I prefer plays over movies. You are the one who steered the car from going to the pub to here."

"Why is that preference?"

She didn't have an answer. "Have you seen any plays?"

"Movies are my thing. No, I haven't seen any."

"We should go to a play once."

Slowly, they walked into the darkness, guided to their seats by a torch. They settled in and were presented with things not to do while at the theatre.

The title card "It's Unpublished, Yet!" appeared, inspired by the article "It's Unpublished Yet!"

The woman whispered into the man's ear, "They're publishing it with the title 'It's Unpublished Yet!' Irony! These days it has become a common trend to be ironic. The irony is predictable and not funny anymore. It makes me think and laugh before it's too late but always falls short."

"The manuscript is still not published; they haven't found the author. The title refers to that. I think it is an apt title."

"It is, but I believe, it is the irony in the title that got the makers excited to use it as the title. It's clearly visible."

He tried to respond, but the movie began.

Five teens are playing roller hockey as a team. The goalkeeper is the eldest of them. Two of them are brothers with an age difference of two years, and the other two are the same age as the eldest sibling. They are all friends from the neighbourhood. They are a soft and sensitive bunch; they give up at the risk of falling down or getting hit, and they are so compassionate that they don't even have to come up with excuses for their mistakes, as all five understand the cost of falling down, getting injured or being hit. They all decide to go on a vacation. The goalkeeper is in search of a new team and refuses to join them on vacation. The siblings work at their dad's factory, and of the other two, one acts as an arbitrator at the local chess club, and the other works at a local library to earn some extra money for the vacation. They make an itinerary of the places to visit, and a song plays with a montage of the places they visit and they tick them off their checklist.

"Quite a boring vacation, don't you think so! No surprise, no thrill, in fact, nothing," she said sardonically.

He was of the same opinion, no thrill or adventure like he in the attire of a retired robber craved for, everything went as per plan but he had to defend himself,  "They are kids. Going alone on such a trip is challenging and adventurous in itself. Look at their meticulous planning..."

The teens on the screen are unhappy with their vacation, but they all keep their feelings to themselves.

"You see they are unhappy too, I told you! It will be predictable .", she triumphantly said.

"They pictured the vacation montage in such a way that we as the audience feel that boredom. That is the way they chose to make us identify with those characters. There is nothing to predict; it is clearly visible."

"You think so? Come on, that is to build up their motivation to go on a journey to find the author after they find the manuscript."

"That's the problem with knowing things beforehand"

"Not my problem, it is a true story the maker should have considered the information that the audience is aware of while designing the experience."

On their return train journey, they find a manuscript. They look around, asking whom it belongs to, and when one guy tries to claim it as his and steal it, they catch his lie. They find this as an opportunity to make their vacation memorable, and they decide to go on a journey to find the author.

He anticipated so loudly that after the previous scene, there would be a revelation that each of the four had secretly wished that they shouldn't find the author on this train, but that has never been addressed on the screen and he is disappointed.

She goes to his ear and murmurs, "Look, these kids are going to stick pamphlets at every station and ensure those pamphlets travel to every village just like a newspaper reaches..." She became critical of her thoughts and continued, "That's brute force and tedious. There is not a thing adventurous about it?"

"Well, it may be tedious. They are just a bunch of kids who could easily resign from what they have embarked on."

"Then there would be no movie. Also, I think you should stop addressing them as kids. If they can easily resign then I bet they are going to learn not to give up on this journey, and play a match in the end and win it."

"Let's see." He resentfully said.

Their return train is delayed. The librarian-teen picks up the manuscript and occupies himself with it. The other three playing freestyle football with a soft drink tin formulate a plan, to make pamphlets and stick them at the local library in the next station, after many disagreements. The late-night train drops them at the next station in the early hours. As they wait for the sun to rise, the elder sibling tired of thinking through this hopeless journey says, "Let’s give it to the station master and drop back home." The librarian-teen reading the manuscript is not aligned with the idea of going back, while the other two, undecided, remain silent. The elder sibling, after not getting any response that he had expected from them, snickers and says that he was just joking. They visit the library and luckily find an elderly person who comes to inspect the library, waiting for it to be opened. After they pitch their idea, he supports them by giving an authorization/order and 1000 copies of pamphlets to stick the pamphlet in every library or town centre.

"I don't think this ever happened in reality," she expressed her dissatisfaction.

 "What?"

"The library inspector authorizing them. How convenient of the writer to place the inspection officer coincidentally to move the story forward quickly. This is disappointing."

He is disappointed that there is no conflict or a situation that challenges the teens so that the compassionate audience could have invested their thoughts and come up with a solution for the teens on the screen. He remains speechless.

They visit the bus stop, pass the order and pamphlet to the bus driver, and ask him to leave one at every stop and get it stuck.

"Yeaa...!, that's another hit. It's predictable and boring, just like the lives of many people in this theatre who live in this small town."

He cannot disagree, he decided to change the way he watched the movie and he tried it without any idea of that way.

A stranger tells the four teens that there is a village which won't receive a newspaper and suggests they go to that village themselves. The elder sibling, maintaining the tour finances, starts to worry about the available funds for the rest of the trip but hesitates to mention it.

After visiting the island village by travelling on a boat, the librarian-teen says he finds the village to be similar to the one mentioned in the manuscript. He tries to convince the other three with the few other similarities, but they say they can't risk the chance of not finding him. They agree to meet exactly after three days and pick an early morning train back home. The librarian goes in search of finding the author in the town. The other three wave goodbye to him and continue their journey. The three of them rush to the railway station to catch a train and are just in time to catch the train to the next station.

The movie reaches to interval and the lights turn on, he turns to her and she sighs "Ahh! The story should have followed the lonely teen at least, instead, they chose to follow the three teens. There is nothing new in this path. They are going to think of returning which they cannot because they can't leave the fourth guy. They are left with the only option of finishing their job and catching up with him 3 days later. I am pretty sure in this gap they are going to reach the threshold to going home, quarrels start to happen among them, and they will lose communication among themselves, which can lead them to lose each other and for a happy ending they find each other after realizing their mistakes, and to be noted they are going to emerge victorious in their next roller hockey game as I said". "By the way how did you like the movie?

"I liked a few moments, them playing football with the tin. You remember the scene where they were dissatisfied with their vacation but after finding the manuscript they go in search of the author on the train. Deep inside I wanted to see each of them wishing that they shouldn't get to find the author on the train. There were many such instances where I anticipated something and the result fell short."

She considered the movie had bored him too and shrugged her shoulders.

They rose and walked out of the theatre along with the crowd, she followed him as he had a peek out through the window, the wind blew but there was no sign of any rain. He stood in the queue, to buy snacks and drinks for the next half, and she joined beside him and she began to feel sympathetic for him and the lady in disguise took over the critic in her and talked through her and they came to a consensus to feels sorry for him. She compassionately said, "Do not worry! It's okay, the scene where you wished to see their intentions while looking for the author,  that cannot be changed in this recorded medium, now you have missed an expectation."

"Thanks for feeling for me. Maybe I was imagining my mischievous self at that age, also it's not gonna change anything, but a little suspicion in the background music could have directed my experience that way".

"True! and nothing is going to change, as I have told you movies are made for a perceived expectation of the crowd.  You may have the most interesting expectation in the room, and you could anticipate it to happen, the makers might have thought about it too. But they won't have enough data to support them in saying that this new scene works. Look at the diverse age group of the crowd, not all of them are mischievous the normalized expectation here would be just they won't find the author on the train. They wouldn't risk experimenting with it. They just try to meet the normalized expectation which works out according to the data."

The man began to comprehend this quite tiresomely. She continued
"I have similar expectations in life, my expectation is never considered in this town- I have to restrict my expectation to a normalized expectation in this town. All these new businesses selling products or providing services, come up only in the big cities because there is a reasonably good volume of crowd expecting it. They take time to come to our town- not all of them come to our town only the successful ones. Even in that case, they have to train us, the public prior. They are creating an expectation before launching it. I came to believe that all my expectations were manufactured by someone, none of them were manufactured by me. It all becomes vicarious. I sometimes wonder whether it's my expectation or the one that these people trained me along with every one of us."

They arrive at the snack vendor "two coke and two popcorn"
He collected his order and they walked back to their seats.

She exemplified,  "We were told that it is a custom to eat popcorn in theatres and I blindly eat it and I happen to like it. But there must have been a time when a group wanted to have popcorn in the theater and someone might have allowed them to have and when the result was positive. The Westerners have created an expectation of it and we all bought it. I never had a wish to have it in the first place."

"True! I cannot agree more, you know after the story went exactly in the direction you said and after experiencing nothing but the disappointment of having anticipated something and having got something mediocre I have decided to retire with the idea of anticipating as I retired from robberies. I would want to just sit and relax, and consume everything I see and listen and mould myself to make sense out of it and finally want to see what it transforms me into"

"Sounds like an interesting Idea" She suspected some kind of foul play in his resignment but her suspicion was not of a good intensity as his resignment was justified. "I might want to try it too".

"I would like to have some compassion for them and be sensitive towards the film."

She embraces the idea, pursuing her lips tightly she nods her head.

They started eating their popcorn sipping off their soda cans as the slides flashed and the movie resumed. The three teens kept travelling station after station and from each station to the bus stop and handed over the pamphlets to the bus drivers, sometimes they had to wait for a few busses to arrive from the round-trip. All three feel and want to quit it and catch the next train back home but having left the fourth guy with a promise to meet in 3 days they struggle within themselves to overcome that thought.

She stopped her critical words as they came out and transformed them "Poor guys what have they signed up for, they needn't have signed up for this"

He smiled at her words without saying anything back and his smile was never visible to her in that darkness. But deep inside she knew she didn't mean those words. She was trying and it was difficult for her.

The teens have planned their sleep mostly in trains but with the crowd in trains, they took a hotel. The hotel people duped them to pay more than they had dealt with. Slowly their pockets start to get empty. They slept on the railway platform. They are having food in limited rations. The arbitrator started to blame the elder sibling who had been managing the finances from the beginning of the trip is being kind towards his brother with the food rations.

In the central station with less than 24 hours left to catch the train back home, the younger sibling gets frustrated for being the cause of the fight takes a few copies and goes away early in the morning.

The frame freezes over the arbitrator fighting the cold and sleeping curled up on one side with his legs and arms pulled close to his body, and slowly the frame tilts over to the elder brother sleeping,  leaning his back to a wall and with hands over the luggage by his side. Cut to a wide top shot revealing the two sleeping on the railway platform among a huge crowd, which pans over to the younger sibling walking out of the station.

He noticed her tense expression, her eyebrows drawn up towards the centre of her forehead, lips pressed together in distress. She uttered quietly, "Go back!" Her tone and the look in her eyes made it clear that she empathized deeply with them at that moment.

The other two wake up and look around for him. The elder brother walks towards the arbitrator and holds him by the shirt and the arbitrator hits him back and they both start fighting.

"Don't fight! look out for him" she cries helplessly

The public stares at them fight until one elderly man interjects and stops the fight.

"Thank god!" She exclaims.

With an elderly man in between they say what had happened and the elder brother reveals that it is his food that he gave to his brother. Arbitrator apologizes.

"Look at the pamphlets, he took away few" The film critic is completely subdued by her disguise and turns completely naive and childish.

The arbitrator notices that a few papers are missing and the list of libraries in the city is half torn. They deduce he might have gone to those libraries. They rise and they go out to visit those libraries. With the clock ticking they reach back to the station to find their brother.

Having successfully delivered pamphlets to all the libraries, they believed it was only a matter of time before the author of the manuscript reached out to them. With that confidence, they boarded the train, ready for the next step in their plan.

As the train started to move, they settled in for the journey, but as the hours passed and the station where the fourth member was supposed to board drew near, a sense of unease began to creep in.

When the train finally arrived at the station, they scanned the platform eagerly, but there was no sign of him. Concerned, the elder sibling quickly got off the train and rushed to the entrance, searching desperately for any hint of his arrival. After a frantic search, he found nothing—no familiar face in the crowd, no message, nothing. Disheartened, he hurried back to the train, hoping they hadn’t missed something.


“What do you think? Maybe the fourth guy already left for home,” he suggested, his tone carrying a hint of intimidation.

“Don’t even think about it. I might curse you if one of the characters gets that idea,” she shot back, rejecting his suggestion outright.

He sighed in relief, realizing she was still invested in the story, and left her to continue watching the movie.

As the train continued its journey, guilt started to gnaw at them for leaving him behind. Soon, worry set in, and they decided that at the next station, they would get off and head to the village to find him.

“They’re not as cold-hearted as you to think of such an idea,” she said impulsively, her words carrying an edge.

The train slowed as it approached the next station, and the trio quickly gathered their luggage and stepped onto the platform. The train had received the green signal and was ready to depart. Just as it began to move, the younger sibling spotted a familiar figure at the far end of the platform, near the entrance—the librarian-teen was sprinting toward the station, followed closely by the boat driver carrying his bag. Before the sibling could react, the librarian-teen shouted with all his might, "Get back on the train!" urging them to reboard before it was too late.

She claps in excitement and her claps are echoed by a few others in the audience.

The train ascends into the sky with the sun gently rising.

"Do you want them to win the roller hockey game now" he tried to influence her thoughts.

"Yes of course"

They are playing roller hockey the teen who was looking for a team change is still keeping for them. The youngest of all scores a goal sparking jubilant celebrations among the team.

Her smile reflects the joy of their victory.

They arrive at the librarian's house and review the register containing the log of calls from people claiming the book but are unable to answer the questions correctly. Just as they are about to leave, they receive another call. They ask the usual questions, and this time, the caller answers them correctly.

Inspired by the article `It's unpublished yet!` the photograph of the article is presented on the screen.

"The book never came out, right?" she said to him enveloped in her seat resisting to get up.

"In truth, No they haven't found the author."

End credits roll! People get up and walk as they both wait in their chairs until the rush has been cleared.

"It reminded me of our football days when we were taken out to another town by our school of course we lost that's another story- The inclination to quarrel it is true," The man said to her

She replied "All it takes is an attitude to forgive and it is beautiful ever after"

The crowd gets clogged at the door and doesn't move. They both made their way through the crowd and she elated in excitement- "It is raining!"

She unwrapped the umbrella and they both walked out under it while raindrops pitter-pattered on it to the other side of the road under the shade.

She walked into the pool of water with the umbrella and jumped with joy.
"I completely forgot we had an umbrella", she exclaimed.
He took out the camera from her handbag and clicked a snap of her embracing the rain allowing it to hit her face and hugging the sky with arms stretched out wide with one arm holding the umbrella away from her, as it showered on her face.

Afterwards, they took an auto home. She looked into her handbag for the keys.
"I cannot find the keys I think I lost them" she panicked.

He pulled the keys from his pocket and said with a grin, "I stole them when I was in character."

As she opened the door,  "You know, robbers watch movies to understand the psyche of the audience and the limits of the mob so they can be sure of what they're capable of."

She playfully hit him.

Back at home, with the lights turned off, she said, "I think I too have transcended like you... this experience is surreal."
Not hearing a response from him, she said, "Good night!" and settled down to sleep.


They took an auto home. She looked into her handbag for the keys.

He takes out keys from his pocket, "I stole them when I was in the character", "You know robbers watch movies to understand the psyche of the audience, the limits of the mob, so when they go for a robbery they can be sure of what they are capable of."

She hits him playfully and they both laugh.

In the quiet of the night, with the lights turned off, she murmured sleepily, "I think I too have transcended like you... this experience is surreal."

She didn't hear a response from him, and with a soft sigh, she said, "Good night!" and nestled into her pillow. As she drifted off to sleep, he, deep in slumber, spoke faintly, "Yeah... movies... characters... unforgettable..."

She smiled at his mumbled words, feeling content as she gathered herself to sleep.

                      An irrational fear had sprung him out of his meditative state to consciousness. He hadn't opened his eyes yet, he tried to handle the fear by reciting the wise words his wife had said to him last night after he woke her up, unable to handle the overwhelming anxiety.

                    "It is okay to feel nervous about the result of the play, with the first two plays having left a feeling of dissatisfaction.
                Don't give much thought to the outcome and the excitement associated with it.
            Just stay with the things that are in your control"

        While reciting them he checked for the presence of the anxiety in him, he found it but he chose to ignore it. He couldn't comfort himself with those words for long. He felt deceived that those wise words didn't have the same effect as they had last night. He tried to keep his spirits up, picturing the consequences of the play's success and it made him feel confident. An intense feeling that he had been in a meditative state for a long time and the expectation that everyone might have risen from their states made him open his eyes. To his surprise, he found all the players and crew still meditating. He rose and walked over to the coach, who was supervising them while flipping through the script pages. The coach had once been the Playmaker. Gardening, writing, reading, nothing could keep the boredom away from him after retirement. He went back to the theatre again, and his presence and availability boosted the morale of the players and crew. As the Playmaker got closer to the Coach, he became reflective about himself and all the inflated confidence fell short of his record, he quickly realized it and inflated it further ignoring his wife's words not to fantasize too much about the outcome.

    The coach kept the script aside and welcomed the pensive-looking Playmaker into his company. He waited for the players and the crew to emerge from their meditative state so they could talk. The players and the crew began to arise from their meditation making loud noise and making others rise from theirs.

Amidst the noise, the Coach muffled to the Playmaker, "Both versions of the script look intact, we should stick to one of them"

The Playmaker extended his ears to him with a pre-meditative idea of rejecting whatever the coach was going to say, "I cannot hear you"

Coach cleared his throat and raised his volume, "I was saying, both versions look great, let's stick to one of the versions"

"Why do you suggest so? From ages, all our plays involved the audience into the play."

"Yes, but I am worried about the impact of its result on you. Your emotional state is deteriorating with the failure of the plays. I want you to keep it simple this time and have your fair share of satisfaction for your work."

"Thank you for your concern. But I am confident, we will pull it off this time and get past that point smoothly."

The Playmaker was not certain as he mentioned, he was shaken from the inside and his trembling hands reflected it.

"It doesn't seem so. Are you sure?"

"If you are still speaking to me with my past two plays in mind. I tried. Not everything lies in my control. I am learning. I am confident about this play, it can smoothly involve the audience."

Before the coach could speak the playmaker challenged him, "You wanna take a bet for your fish."

He absorbed the Playmaker's blustering swagger and remained silent. One of the crew members hurried towards the Playmaker and informed him that the sample audience group was ready for the narration. The Playmaker rose and paused to accept the wishes from the Coach. As he walked towards the group, he pondered the expression on the Coach's face. While wishing, he felt it didn't complement his words, and that smile on his face resembled a mockery, suggesting that he wouldn't be able to achieve success in this play either. It bothered him, and it started to make him angry. He tried to make peace with his anger, but he had already reached the group of the audience waiting for him. He walked into them, and they formed a semicircle around him. The group included people of diverse age groups. Glancing at them, he took a heavy breath.


"Alright! Here we all are for the ritual before every play. Oh, I see a few new kids today. Welcome! Here's what we do: I’ll be narrating a story, and after a certain point, I’ll stop, and you’ll watch the rest unfold through the acts of the play. If anyone wants to leave, feel free to do so now, but please not in the middle. Most importantly, stay back after the play—we want to hear your thoughts."

*Four teens are in search of the author of a nameless manuscript they found during their train journey. Their quest led them to our village. While travelling by boat, one of the teens began noticing similarities between the places described in the manuscript and our village. By the time they crossed the river and reached the village bank, the teen was convinced that the author was from here. His confidence doubled when he discovered that the boat driver's name was the same as the last name of the hero of the manuscript.*

"Did our boat driver write a book?" queried a curious kid from the group.

Other keen listeners gasped at this interruption, this had been a worry to them every time a new kid joined them for a narration.

"Who knows? I don't know?" the Playmaker currently in the shoes of the narrator blurted

"Didn't you write the play based on what happened?" the curious kid asked warily.

Others from the group sighed in disappointment and exclaimed,
"This kid is ruining the experience.
No questioning while listening.
Travel with your doubts till the end of the play.
They will be answered.

This kept the curious kid on the spot and made him uncomfortable. The narrator noticed it and he lifted his arms upwards and flapped his palms towards the ground. Repeating this gesture, he suppressed the heat of disappointment in the crowd.

"Well it's okay with him being a first-timer, but all of your queries would be answered by the end of the play." He made the kid feel comfortable.

*Moving on... the teen who suspected that the author was from our village shared his thoughts with his friends as they walked toward the village centre. They listened intently, asking him how he was so certain that the author was from this village. He explained his reasoning, and when he felt they were convinced, he proposed staying back to search for the author here. However, the other three bluntly rejected the idea, arguing that they might risk missing the author in another town if they spent all their time in this village. Instead, they put up a pamphlet announcing that they were looking for the author of the lost manuscript and began walking back to the boat. They left the curious teen behind with the plan that they would catch the early morning train exactly two days from now.*

*On the riverbank, our boat driver noticed that only three of the teens had returned. Concerned, he inquired about the whereabouts of the fourth teen. After learning what had happened, he asked his friend to row the three back to the other side and quickly hurried towards the village centre.*

*Somewhere in the village, away from the centre, the teen found himself alone with his backpack. Determined, he went around asking everyone he encountered, showing them the manuscript and asking if they had written it or if they knew anyone who might have. His questions were met with nothing but hysterical laughs, as if to say, "No one from this village could have ever written a book like this." Just then, the boat driver came running towards him, bending over and panting for breath. Between gasps, he said that he had been searching for him all around the village centre.*

*The teen, being an outsider, was informed by the boat driver that no tourist stays overnight in the village due to their socialist way of living, where food is bartered among the villagers. Concerned for the teen’s well-being, he took him to his house. As they walked, the boat driver roughly inquired about whom the teen had spoken to regarding the book and what each person had said. The teen couldn't help but notice a hint of anxiety in the boat driver's questions and sensed his relief upon learning that the teen hadn't gotten any leads on who the author might be. This odd behaviour made the boat driver his only suspect, but the teen was left puzzled, unable to form a clear hypothesis as to why the boat driver would deny writing it. The thought lingered in his mind, leaving him deep in contemplation.*

*At home, during dinner, the teen asked the boat driver numerous questions that had arisen while reading the manuscript, probing into how such a town could manage its social needs. He gradually steered the conversation towards whether the boat driver had ever travelled outside the village and how he felt about returning. The boat driver provided an elaborate response, but the teen, uninterested in the lengthy explanation, waited patiently to ask the most crucial question: "When was the last time you went out of town?" The boat driver answered that it had been a long time.*

*The teen wished the answer was a lie but proceeded to ask, "When you went out of the village, did you travel by train or bus? Do you like travelling by train?" As he asked, he watched for any signs of nervousness or tension on the boat driver's face, such as sweating or avoiding eye contact. He noticed a few signs that seemed to confirm his suspicions.*

*The next morning, the boat driver insisted on staying with the teen and accompanied him to the village centre. The boat driver took some amusement in the teen’s predicament. After discovering that none of the people gathered around the pamphlet, which was stuck to the tree's trunk, could read it, the teen had to stretch his voice to relay the contents to everyone with curious eyes on the flyer.*

*To alleviate the teen's frustration, the boat driver pointed out individuals who seemed unlikely to know the author. He also took the initiative to inform his fellow villagers about the pamphlet's contents and inquired if they knew anyone who could have possibly written the manuscript.*

*Exhausted but still without any leads, the teen returned home with the boat driver in the evening for dinner. That night, he couldn’t sleep, unable to come up with any new plans to find the author. Worried and restless, he reviewed the manuscript late into the night, hoping for some inspiration.*

*A squeaking noise startled him—it was the cupboard door. When he opened it to fix the sound, everything inside fell out; the cupboard was overstuffed. He ensured that the noise had not disturbed the boat driver and started to place the items back inside. Among them, he discovered a book. Upon examining its text, he considered the possibility that the boat driver could write. He wasn't sure if the handwriting matched, but he thought that if asked, the boat driver would likely deny authorship. The teen resolved to question him subtly when the opportunity arose.*

*The discovery fueled his curiosity about why someone would hide their ability to read and write and abandon a book they had invested a lot of time and effort into. Despite his contemplation, he couldn't find a satisfactory explanation.*

*He meticulously reviewed the manuscript and identified a few characters whose traits resembled those of people he had encountered earlier in the day. An idea began to take shape, forming into a plan. He compiled a list of all the primary characters and their characteristics, trusting his intuition that one of them was either the author or knew the author. As he reviewed the list, he remembered that the boat driver had blocked one of the villagers, who bore similarities to a character, from reaching him that morning, claiming that he was not a likely candidate.*

*This led him to believe with increasing certainty that the boat driver was the author, or at the very least knew who the author was. The next morning, he asked the boat driver to take him to see the list of characters, starting with the one who had been prevented from reaching him. As expected, the boat driver tried to deter the teen from speaking to this individual, but the teen persisted.*

*The teen deliberately spilt some tea on one of the papers and, while pretending to be busy, asked the boat driver to help by writing up the content that had been erased by the spill. The boat driver momentarily picked up a pen but then deftly avoided the task, saying he knew where the character lived.*

*They visited every person on the list and returned home by evening with no promising results. However, during one of their visits, the teen overheard a conversation between the boat driver and one of the characters. They were discussing the boat driver’s recent trip to the town, precisely on the day the manuscript was discovered. The teen listened intently but kept his questions to himself. The boat driver's denial of travelling by train only reinforced the teen's suspicion that he might be the manuscript’s author.*

*Realizing that his conflicting statements had been noticed, the boat driver tried to explain that he had lied to the character because the character had wanted him to take him out sometime. The teen dismissed this explanation as a lie.*

*Feeling a sense of unease, the teen acknowledged that not everything like the reasoning behind the author leaving the manuscript could not be explained rationally. Reflecting on their journey, he thought that, if they were completely rational, they would have left the manuscript with the station master and returned home instead of pursuing it further.*

*During lunch with the boat driver, the teen observed the boat driver’s unusually kind demeanour, which he interpreted as a sign of guilt. Believing that honesty might prompt the boat driver to reveal the truth, the teen expressed his disappointment and lack of hope despite his efforts. He mentioned that he would have to leave the next morning and asked the boat driver how he could repay the kindness he had received.*

*Moved by the teen’s situation, the boat driver suggested that he teach map curation at their Montessori. The teen agreed and, after lunch, spent the afternoon at the Montessori, teaching the children there.*

“We end our narrative here. Thank you!”

“Well, did our boat driver tell him that he is the author?” a kid from the audience group asked impulsively, without any hesitation.

The rest of the audience shushed him.

“Now we will watch the remaining story in the form of a play.”

“Enjoy the play!”

The Playmaker turned back and climbed the stairs next to the curtain. As the curtain rose slowly, a waiting room between the entrance and the Principal's office came into view.

Four kids, all around the teen's age, sat there, each gripping a piece of paper, while their teacher kept a strict eye on them, ensuring they stayed silent.

Despite the teacher's efforts, the kids exchanged nervous glances, gesturing to one another not to worry and subtly showing their papers. Their initial signals soon turned into more inventive ways to communicate, mainly to annoy the teacher.

But one of the four stood out—stern, obedient, and frozen in his seat. Fear seemed to grip him, and he muttered something under his breath, his eyes repeatedly darting to the paper in his hand. Unlike the others, he didn’t join in their attempts to tease the teacher, his growing anxiety evident as he grew more fidgety by the minute.

The director sat next to the coach and watched the performance from the wings. The coach, mesmerized by the way the obedient kid captured his role, leaned in and murmured, "He’s nailing it". The director glanced at the coach, his voice tinged with trepidation. "Do you really know what's happening out there? I’m afraid he might ruin the play. No doubt, he’s acting well—too well. That’s exactly what’s going to wreck this. He’s captivated the audience, and drawn all their attention. But by now, they should be rooting for the teen to find the author, desperate for him to confront the boat driver with time running out. His performance is making them forget all of that."

The Playmaker cued the actor playing the fourth teen to step out from the principal's office. Hidden behind the prop door, which was held by an unseen crew member, the teen character walked out. The crew member discreetly pulled the door at an angle, creating the illusion that it had been closed by the wind. In the lobby, the teen character noticed the others standing under the teacher’s watchful eye and asked, "What happened?"
All three said equivocally, "They suspected us of spreading a rumour"

"a rumour?"

"some silly one to laugh at and not a serious one to feel sad about. but this guy... you know we even apologized to him"

pointing at the papers "Are these apologies?" the teen-character queried

"Nah, we were asked to write down the rumour as we heard it. They want to determine who started it based on how much we know from what we wrote and by comparing it with what others have written."

The teen-character's eyes widened as a new idea struck him. "You mean, you told one of these two, and then one of them passed it on to someone else, and it just spread from there..."

"Yes, sort of. They traced it back to us as the source."

"Have they identified the correct source?"

"It's for them to determine. It seems fairly accurate so far."

"Good luck then."

"Thanks! See you tomorrow."

"I'll be leaving early in the morning, so I might not see you."

"Did you find the author?"

He stayed silent.

"You should try some of the principal’s ideas."

The four exited the stage, stepping through a door marked "Principal." As the curtain fell, the set was quickly reconfigured to resemble the principal's office. When the curtain rose again, the scene was set.

Inside the principal's office, the four students gathered around the principal as the school bell rang. All eyes turned to the windows, with the principal being the first to glance outside. The teacher swiftly refocused their attention on the task at hand. With the teacher's assistance, the principal examined their writings. "This student appears to be the origin of the rumour," he said. "His account is the least updated and still retains elements from the original story."

The principal fixed his gaze on the accused student, who adamantly denied any involvement. Just then, a peon knocked on the door and relayed a message: "Madam has arrived and is waiting for you." The principal instructed the peon to return, saying he would join her shortly.

Turning to the four students and the teacher, the principal noted that three of the students, excluding the obedient one, looked visibly relieved at the prospect of his departure. The principal explained that he had urgent matters to attend to, which his wife had insisted upon. He directed the teacher to deal with the situation by suspending the accused student and warning the other three.

The stage shifted to a riverbank, and the scene unfolded on a boat drifting silently on the water, just before sunrise.

The teen and the boat driver exchanged thoughts on the things that lightened their spirits. As the scene shifted to the railway station, the train loomed in the background. The teen turned to the boat driver and asked, “Did you forget to say something?”

The boat driver shook his head, replying, “No,” and then added, “I’m sorry if I gave you the impression that I am the author.”

As the play concluded, some members of the audience lingered, applauding warmly, while others, ready to leave, began making their way out. The director, watching them go, called out, "Thank you all! We look forward to seeing you at the evening performance."

The director and coach's eyes met, and the director quickly averted his gaze in embarrassment, heading straight for the kid who played the obedient role in the play. Surrounded by fellow actors who were changing out of their rehearsal costumes and basking in each other's praise, the Playmaker stormed in and demanded, "How do you think you performed?"

The obedient kid, engrossed in packing his bags, did not turn around. He was certain the anger wasn’t aimed at him. After a moment of silence, he reluctantly turned, his shirt flapping as he spun around. His face went pale as he saw the Playmaker standing before him, arms folded, eyes blazing with fury. The others, sensing the tension, busied themselves with their tasks, leaving him to face the director’s wrath alone.

"How dare you steal the show?" the Playmaker snapped.

"I didn’t, I was just—"

"Just what? You weren’t giving cues to anyone."

"When someone comes up with a great idea, your act undermined it instead of building on it."

"You know what? You're selfish and you don’t belong in this theatre."

"I’m not selfish." The term stung, a harsh reminder of the village where sharing was everything, and selfishness was despised.

"You are, and you’d better come to terms with it."

After the playmaker left, the kid felt the sting of possible judgment from his fellow actors. Tears began to roll down his cheeks as he hastily emptied and repacked his bag. One by one, the other players left, having changed and gathered their belongings, some offering a sympathetic pat on his back as they went.

Anger at the playmaker simmered within him, but with his debut looming in just a few hours, he didn’t want to let it consume him. Instead, he found himself overwhelmed by self-loathing, a feeling magnified by his current predicament. He longed for the comfort of his friend, the one who had always been there to help him through such moments, to whom he’d confided his pain and who had soothed him.

Yet, they were not on speaking terms. He despised himself for the fight they’d had. The more he dwelled on his anger and frustration, the more he began to detest himself, even more than he hated the playmaker. In his desperation, he clung to the hope that he could make amends. He vowed to himself that he would reach out to her, apologize, and mend their friendship, hoping it would ease the self-reproach that had taken hold of him.

The coach entered the room and noticed the obedient-kid's efforts to conceal his distress. “You’re still here? I nearly locked up,” he remarked.

The obedient-kid, his voice barely audible, replied, “Just about to leave.”

Sensing the tremor in the obedient-kid’s voice, the coach approached him. It quickly became apparent from the tear-streaked face that the obedient-kid was struggling.

“What’s wrong?” the coach asked softly.

“Nothing,” the obedient-kid mumbled, his voice quivering.

The coach’s patience wore thin. “Save the drama for the stage. What’s bothering you?”

After a moment of fighting back his tears, the obedient-kid finally burst out, “He called me selfish,” and began to sob.

The coach’s tone softened. “Oh, come on. Don’t let that get to you. He probably meant the character, not you personally. The character was meant to be selfish, and driven by fear. You played that role perfectly and captured all the details. You did a great job.”

The obedient-kid wiped his tears, seeking comfort in the coach’s reassuring words.

 "You know what? That’s precisely the issue. It drew too much attention to the character. It’s not your fault; you’re meant to captivate the audience, and you did that perfectly. But only when we are performing a classic. In plays like these, your role's objective is to reflect the anticipation of the audience. We use your performance to gauge their reactions and decide which climax to present based on their expectations.”

The obedient-kid remains silent without uttering a word with his head dropped down and his elbows resting on the thighs.

The coach waited for him to say something, "Did you get it?" "Say yes, say no"

The obedient-kid feebly said "Yes".

Coach rubbed on the kid's back

You know," the coach began, "when I was around your age, being an actor was my only dream. But I couldn’t get the act right and ended up being terribly bashed for it. I felt awful and thought it would only complicate my performance even more. The more I dwelled on it, the worse my feelings became. I decided to spend the day alone, doing something I loved until it was time for the play. I went out fishing, cast my line, and wandered a bit. Suddenly, a fish caught the bait, then another, and by the end of the day, I’d caught 29 fish. I was overjoyed. When it was time for the play, not a single thought of the morning’s failure crossed my mind. I stepped onto the stage with confidence, and I was very satisfied when the audience clapped. My teacher did too, on my exit. All I want to say is, forget about this and focus on something that brings you joy".

The obedient-kid felt lighter after listening to the coach’s story. But the idea that put him on this path of feeling lighter, to meet, apologize to her and become friends with her, has now become a courageous pursuit.

"Sure," he said to the Coach.

The obedient kid gathered his belongings and left the theatre compound, where his wild pet dog awaited him eagerly. He rushed over, brushing the dust from its fur. Playfully, he cupped the dog's face and asked with a grin if it was hungry.


He walked closely behind his dog, matching its every step. At a crossing, the pet paused after a few strides, expecting to hear the familiar sound of footsteps. When the expected sound didn’t come, it turned back and saw that he had veered from their usual path onto a small bridge spanning the river. Overcome with immense joy, the pet rushed toward him, barking with exuberance and a hint of melancholy. He bent down and lovingly brushed his hand over the pet's head.

The dog led him along the path he had chosen, beginning to rush ahead. He had to run to keep up with it. They visited his friend’s house, but she wasn’t there. The pet took him to various places where she might be, and he followed, but they found no sign of her. Disappointed, they made their way back home. He served food to his pet as his mother served food to him.

They quickly finished their meal, brushing off his mother's concern that they might choke from eating too fast. Without delay, they rushed to the riverbank beside the forest, where he hoped to ask a friend for a small fishing boat.

Leaving his pet on the riverbank to play, he gently reminded it not to wander into the wild. He rowed into the river and skillfully wedged his boat between the rocks, ensuring it wouldn't drift with the stream.

He baited the hook with a worm and cast it into the river. As minutes passed, his thoughts drifted to the past, searching for moments of selfishness. No fish took the bait, but his mind latched onto a memory that confirmed his guilt. The harder he tried to push it away, the clearer it became: a time when he denied having something, even though he did, when a friend had asked for it. He resolved to apologize, but doubt crept in. Would his friend think of him as crazy for bringing it up after all these years? Still, he decided, no matter what, he would apologize and never act that way again.

He reeled in the line and checked the hook, only to find that the fish had cleaned off the bait without getting caught. Glancing at his sleeping pet, he changed the bait and cast it into the river once more. An hour slipped by, but no fish took the bait. His thoughts, however, began to reel in memories of other moments when he had been selfish. Bothered by these thoughts and unable to find resolution, he continued to wait, hoping for luck.

To keep his spirits up, he started recalling the happier memories he shared with her—the day they became friends after pulling a mischievous prank at school, the fun they had during the family outing outside the village, and how they both grew to hold similar opinions about their village lifestyle. He thought of the lengths they went for the gifts and the gifts they exchanged for each other's birthdays.

As he drifted through these memories, the fishing rod suddenly felt heavy in his hand, but when he lifted it, the weight disappeared. He tried to return to his thoughts about her—specifically, the birthday. It was her birthday, and that memory brought to mind the instance that had caused a rift between them. She had asked him to join her in exploring the scenic spots around the village, but he had refused, choosing instead to play mud games with his other friends.

He realized it was his mistake, and the nagging thought crept in: was he selfish at that moment? As if responding to his unspoken question, a voice from deep within, echoing like the playmaker's, spoke to him: "You were selfish. If you had refused because of an obligation for a play or rehearsal, it wouldn’t have been selfish, but you refused for the sheer pleasure of playing in the mud with your friends—something you could have easily compromised on, yet you chose to compromise on her wish instead."

Shame washed over him, and he struggled to accept this harsh truth. In a futile attempt to make himself feel better, he compared his actions to those of the guy who had come from outside the village in search of the author, reasoning that selfishness was almost expected in someone so focused on their goal. But he quickly dismissed the comparison, recognizing that it wasn’t right to excuse his behaviour by comparing himself to an outsider who unlike people from their village might act selfishly for a purpose.

Time dragged on, each moment heavier than the last, and the painful realization weighed on him. As the sun dipped toward the horizon, he finally gave up on catching any fish and began to row back toward the bank, feeling the burden of the day’s reflections.

His pet, on the riverbank, was being intimidated by a hare. He called out, urging the dog not to engage, but the dog lunged at the hare. The hare darted into the woods, and his pet gave chase. Panic surged through him. He rowed quickly the boat towards the bank, jumped into the water, pulled the boat ashore, tied it up, and rushed into the woods in search of his pet.

He followed the trail of his pet’s barks through the bushes, but when the sound vanished, he pursued the movement of the bushes, which led him deeper into the forest. He found himself in a dense part of the woods, where both the sound of his dog’s barking and the sight of moving bushes had disappeared. Desperate, he wandered through the thick foliage, calling out for his pet with mounting fear. His heart raced with the dread of what might have happened to the dog, his tears mingling with the forest’s shadows as he searched in vain.

He looked all around, hating himself for following and imitating the Coach's misguided advice. Tears rolled down his cheeks as he realized the play might have already started and he was still unable to find his pet. He felt utterly helpless. Faced with the agonizing choice between giving up his debut—the thing he was most passionate about—or abandoning his search and hoping the pet would return by morning, he chose to forgo his debut. With renewed determination, he continued his search for the pet, unwilling to give up. As he pushed deeper into the forest, he finally caught sight of his pet in the distance, poised to jump across a small stream of water. With a relieved shout, he called out to the dog, who turned and looked back at him.

He sprinted through the village streets toward the theater, his pet bounding alongside him, matching his pace with eager strides.

As he arrived at the theatre, he was greeted by the sound of uproarious laughter from the crowd. Peering through the entrance, he saw the stage illuminated by the comedic scene where the teen-character discovered that none of the villagers could read the pamphlet stuck to the tree's trunk.
Relieved that his act was still some time away, he scanned the audience for her. His eyes lit up when he spotted her, laughing and enjoying the scene with the crowd. With a mix of nervousness and anticipation, he made his way backstage, bracing himself for any remarks from the Playmaker about his tardiness. To his surprise, the Playmaker said nothing about his late arrival. He went to change into his costume and noticed a new face, his friend, dressed in the role’s costume and being attended by a makeup artist. The coach was instructing him on what needed to be done. Gathering his courage, he approached the coach, but the coach didn’t acknowledge him. Taking a deep breath, he said, “I’m sorry that I’m late.”

“You don’t have to be, you may have to postpone your debut,” the coach said. “He will be playing your role today.”

“But we still have time for my entrance,” he protested.

“Not your entrance anymore. We promised him he would be taking your part.”

“I lost my pet in the woods,” he explained. “I was afraid it might become prey to the wild, so I went out to find it.”

“Well, you had your priorities,” the coach said.

“I couldn’t let it become prey,” he insisted. “I’m lucky to be here at all. Not only the Playmaker, but the entire village would have seen me as selfish if I’d left the pet to fend for itself and come here to act.”

The coach sighed and asked, “What do you want me to do now?”

“Ask the Playmaker for my role back.”

“We already offered it to him; that would be impossible.”

“You didn’t even try.”

“We already offered it to him.”

“Well, one of us is going to be disappointed today,” he said sharply. “I’ll blame it all on you and your dumb fishing story. I was foolish to imitate your story, hoping things would turn out like they did for you. I would have preferred to live it my way, finding her and spending time with her. Not a single fish even bit the hook.”


The makeup artist, shocked by the tone of the obedient kid, paused mid-application, his eyes wide with surprise. The new kid, his substitute, glanced at the coach with a pleading look, silently urging him to resolve the conflict in his favor.

Embarrassed by the unfolding situation, the coach’s stern demeanor softened. He took a deep breath, trying to balance his authority with an understanding of the emotional weight of the moment. “I understand you’re frustrated,” the coach said, his voice gentler. “I’m sorry things didn’t turn out as you hoped. I didn’t mean to make it worse.” He gestured toward the new kid and the makeup artist. “I’ll see if there’s any way we can make this right.”

The coach took responsibility and walked backstage, where the stage was being prepared for the scene where the teen discovers the boat driver can read and write. He sought out the Playmaker, who was overseeing the setup.

"He’s back and ready to play," the coach said, catching a moment of the Playmaker’s attention.

The Playmaker looked up, his expression unreadable. “Yes, I saw him, but we gave his role to another kid.”

The coach persisted, “I know. He had a genuine reason for not being here on time.”

"ignoring his reasons and him being late for a moment. The risk of failure with an actor who hasn't rehearsed is higher. Forget about the new-kid suggesting to us the information for the change of course of the play he may bomb the actual play. The obedient kid can at least pull the role he is given. Who knows what effect the word you used had on him? He might even perform better."

The playmaker pondered for a while and was called by the crew for some instructions. As he went there, the coach interrupted him, "What did you think"

"I am not going to say it to the new-kid"

Coach with a smile of relief on his face said "Thank you"

The Coach walked back to the two kids, both filled with anticipation and anxiety.
"I need to speak with you for a moment," the coach said, calling over the anxious new substitute.

The obedient kid, though shifting nervously, kept his ears tuned to their conversation.

"I’m sorry to say this," the coach began, "but you won’t be debuting today."

The new kid’s face fell with disappointment, but he made no protest.

"You will get your chance to debut soon, I promise," the coach added reassuringly.

"I need to rush, My parents would be expecting me on stage. I have to let them know."

The kid rushed away as the obedient kid stared at him.


The coach instructed the makeup artist to prepare the obedient kid for his role. As the artist worked, the obedient kid began to sweat profusely. The makeup artist noticed and said, “Relax and try not to think about anything.”

“I’m trying,” the obedient kid replied, his anxiety evident, “but I can’t help it.”

“Don’t try—just stop it,” the makeup artist urged. “What happened to all the courage you showed a few minutes ago?”

The obedient kid’s sweating increased, and the makeup artist added with a hint of concern, “If you keep sweating like this, I might have to suggest using that other kid after all.”

“I’m just scared,” the obedient kid confessed. “After all this, I don’t want to disappoint.”

The make-up artist offered him some water and the obedient kid took a sip, attempting to calm himself.

Four kids of the teen's age are waiting each with a paper in their hands under the supervision of their teacher who was preventing them from having a conversation. These kids however gesture to each other not to be scared showing the papers in their hands. Soon they came up with more ways to communicate among themselves only for the sake of irritating the teacher.

On the stage, four kids, all around the teen's age, sat there, each gripping a piece of paper, while their teacher kept a strict eye on them, ensuring they stayed silent.

Despite the teacher's efforts, the kids exchanged nervous glances, gesturing to one another not to worry and subtly showing their papers. Their initial signals soon turned into more inventive ways to communicate, mainly to annoy the teacher.

After a challenging day, the obedient kid struggled to recall any of the expressions he had prepared. Relying on cues from his fellow actors, he joined them in their mischievous antics against the teacher.

Backstage, the Playmaker, with a satisfied grin, reported to the coach, “He’s neither stealing the show nor making his presence felt. It appears he’s successfully blended into the background.”

The director cued the actor playing the fourth teen to step out from the principal's office. Hidden behind the prop door, which was held by an unseen crew member, the teen character walked out. The crew member discreetly pulled the door at an angle, creating the illusion that it had been closed by the wind. In the lobby, the teen character noticed the others standing under the teacher’s watchful eye and asked, "What happened?"
All three said equivocally, "They suspected us of spreading a rumour"

"a rumour?"

"some silly one to laugh at and not a serious one to feel sad about. but this guy... you know we even apologized to him"

pointing at the papers "Are these apologies?" the teen-character queried

"Nah, we were asked to write down the rumour as we heard it. They want to determine who started it based on how much we know from what we wrote and by comparing it with what others have written."

The teen-character's eyes widened as a new idea struck him. "You mean, you told one of these two, and then one of them passed it on to someone else, and it just spread from there..."

"Yes, sort of. They traced it back to us as the source."

"Have they identified the correct source?"

"It's for them to determine. It seems fairly accurate so far."

"Good luck then."

"Thanks! See you tomorrow."

"I'll be leaving early in the morning, so I might not see you."

"Did you find the author?"

He stayed silent.

"You should try some of the principal’s ideas."

The four exited the stage, stepping through a door marked "Principal." As the curtain fell, the set was quickly reconfigured to resemble the principal's office. When the curtain rose again, the scene was set.

Inside the principal's office, the four students gathered around the principal as the school bell rang. All eyes turned to the windows, with the principal being the first to glance outside. The teacher swiftly refocused their attention on the task at hand. With the teacher's assistance, the principal examined their writings. "This student appears to be the origin of the rumour," he said. "His account is the least updated and still retains elements from the original story."

The principal fixed his gaze on the accused student, who adamantly denied any involvement.
Inside the Principal's cabinet, the four gathered around him and the school bell rang, all of them had their attention towards the windows and the principal was the first among them but the teacher got all of them back to the situation they were dealing with. With the help of the teacher, the Principal read their writings, "This guy seems to have created the rumour because his version pretends to be the least upgraded and it also to an extent has the roots of the rumour in it. Principal looked at him and the kid responded that he did not do it."


"He didn’t read them thoroughly," the obedient kid complained, casting a sharp glance at the teacher.

"Don’t lie," the teacher retorted, visibly agitated.

Just then, a peon knocked on the door and relayed a message: "Madam has arrived and is waiting for you." The principal, distracted momentarily, instructed the peon to return, saying he would join her shortly.

The principal looked at all four and the teacher, three of them except the obedient kid are happy that the principal is going to leave and they would be relieved. The obedient kid uncharacteristically joined them.

The principal, however, turned to the next letter. Before he could proceed, the obedient kid pressed, "You going to skim this one too?"

The principal paused, taken aback by the boldness of the question. The obedient kid continued, "If you plan to punish us, at least read it thoroughly first."

The peon knocked on the door, and the principal, engrossed in reading their letters, hesitated, visibly struggling with the decision to signal the peon in. Instead, he remained focused, continuing to read through each letter, marking them meticulously, while the room grew increasingly tense with every passing moment.

The lights on the stage dimmed to darkness, and the Playmaker's voice resonated through the theatre as he narrated, "Inspired by a principal's method of probing the truth, the teen delved into the manuscript, searching for hidden secrets. He uncovered a secret buried within the lines—the boat driver, during one of his journeys, had capsized and nearly drowned, only to be saved by an unknown rescuer. A tale known to none but the waves of the river."

The stage transformed into a riverbank on a moonless night. The teen stood by the water's edge, clutching the manuscript, his eyes scanning the dark expanse. Soon, the boat driver appeared, quietly securing his boat before joining him.
"Did you ever tell anyone that your boat capsized and you nearly drowned?" the teen asked, his voice low but insistent.
After a pause, the boat driver nodded. "I told my girlfriend."
"I thought you'd deny it," the teen responded, watching the driver's face closely.
The boat driver said nothing, his mind drifting back to that fateful day.
"And you trust her?" the teen pressed.
"She wouldn't tell anyone," the boat driver replied, with a hint of certainty.
"And the rescuer?" the teen continued.
"He might have," the boat driver admitted.
"Can I meet both of them?" the teen asked.
The boat driver hesitated for a moment before saying, "Wait near the tree. I’ll bring them to you."

The teen waited near the tree, the shadows of the night stretching long and still. The boat driver returned, this time with his girlfriend by his side.

"Did you tell anyone about what happened?" the teen asked her directly.

She shook her head. "No."

"How can I trust you?" the teen pressed.

"I wouldn’t spread such a story about my fiancé," she replied firmly. "My parents wouldn’t let me marry him if they heard about this."

Moments later, the rescuer arrived. The teen asked him the same question.
The rescuer hesitated before confessing, "I’m sorry. I mentioned it to the actor on stage. I thought his performance might improve if he had some inside knowledge about the village, so it could be seen as improvisation. But after that, he stopped talking to me."

"Did you tell anyone else?" the teen asked.

"No," the rescuer responded, shaking his head.

"Could anyone else have overheard?" the teen inquired.

The rescuer paused, then added, "I told the actor while we were in the water ambulance. It's possible the medic overheard us talking about it."

The stage transitioned to resemble the actor's chambers, with actors bustling about, changing out of their costumes and into their regular clothes. Amidst the activity, the actor, half-cleared of his makeup, noticed the teen and discreetly led him away from the others.

In a hushed tone, he confessed, "I haven’t written any book." He paused, glancing around to ensure no one was listening, then continued, "Ever since I heard that story, my performance started overshadowing the others, and it threw off the balance of the play. Because of that, they stopped giving me good roles."

The Playmaker’s voice resonated through the dimmed theatre, "As the clock struck 2 AM, the teen knew he had a train to catch at 4 AM, but the boat ambulance was nowhere in sight. The boat driver rowed frantically, turning this way and that, desperate to spot it. At last, they caught sight of the ambulance in the distance. When they reached it, the medic aboard admitted that he had overheard the story but assured them he neither had the time to write it down nor any interest in sharing it with anyone. They rushed to the other side of the river bank. They ran to the boat driver's friend's house and collected the bike. Together, they sped toward the railway station, their anxiety growing as they worried they might miss the train at one stop, forcing them to aim for the next."

The stage transforms into a railway station, where the wind blows gently, scattering fallen leaves across the platform. The teen stands at the edge, reflecting on his efforts.

"I guess this is the first time in my life I didn't give up, regardless of the outcome. We play roller hockey back home, and I'm always the most scared, often getting injured. I've always blamed myself for inducing the fear on my teammates. It’s become a part of us, making us lazy and complacent. But you know, when I heard your name, which was also mentioned in the manuscript, I thought it must be you. I wanted to confirm it was you. Deep down, I was scared and wanted to hear it from you. I am obviously sad I haven't found the author, but I’m satisfied that I tried and didn't give up."

The boat driver remains silent as the train arrives. The teen boards, ready for his journey. As they part ways, the boat driver says, "I’m sorry if I gave any sign that led you to think it was me."

As the play concluded, the theatre erupted in applause and whistles. The actors, radiant from their successful performance, took their positions on stage, bowing deeply to the enthusiastic crowd. The Coach embraced the Playmaker, who, despite the tears of joy glistening in his eyes, quickly composed himself. The Playmaker stepped forward, addressing the audience with heartfelt gratitude.

"Thank you! We have witnessed the most patient crowd today, who allowed us to unfold our story without rushing to conclusions."

Amidst the audience, the obedient kid spotted his girlfriend. Their eyes locked, and she responded to his smile with an exuberant cheer. In the distance, a tourist clapped out of rhythm but with evident appreciation, adding to the vibrant atmosphere.

As the curtains gently closed, the cast and crew shared smiles of contentment. Backstage, the Playmaker approached the obedient kid and offered a reassuring pat on the back.

"Great job," he said.

The obedient kid walked over to the kid who should have played his role and, with genuine remorse in his voice, said, "I am very sorry for the circumstances that created false hopes and expectations for you and your family. It was selfish of me to demand my role back. I am deeply grateful to you; had you not taken that chance, I might never have realized my own selfishness. Performing tonight made me understand what it truly means to be selfless. Thank you very much, and please forgive me."

#                 With trees alongside the road, the sound of the wind is loud. A whirring noise enters the space, gradually picks up intensity and occupies the entire space. The intensity is maintained, only for the time the sand stays at the neck of an hourglass and, gradually drops at the same pace, leaving the entire space again for the wind. The loose half-sleeve shirt of a 24-year-old boy, standing with his left arm extended and thumb popped out of his fists, flaps on his body soon after the whirring sound has reached its peak. 

#             He has been waiting there by the highway under the sun, in hope of a ride for quite some time. He was in a similar situation the day before yesterday but at a different location, where he wants to go now. Nothing more had changed, except earlier he was constantly fueled with excitement and energy, thinking about her and all the possibilities of sharing life with her. Now, every thought of her is putting him to work, to prevent demolition of the dream castles he had built, and draining his energy . He had forgotten that he hadn't eaten anything or drank water for a long time. 

#         He sees a car entering his horizon with a whirring sound; he extends his left arm and pops out his thumb. Only this time, the car doesn't reach its peak when it nears him. The car stops just after passing him, and an elderly man pops out of the window, turns back to him, and waves for him to get in. He picks up his backpack and rushes towards the car. As he gets into the car, the elderly man's wife, in the driving seat, greets him.

#     The sense of relief in finding the ride doesn't last long, overtaken just like a fast-moving car overtook their halted car while he got in. With his thoughts of hope about finding the ride put to rest and with the prevailing silence in the car, the noise in his head is bright, clear and precise. "I shouldn't have rushed..." "Why do I have to be so excited?" "Why did my parents pamper me so much as a child?" "why didn't my friends contain my excitement?" "I should have let her know who I am and, in fact, more about me.". "Who asks a stranger, 'Will you marry me?'" "and who will say yes to a stranger.".

# Each one of his regrets opened a new door, took him to the deepest of the depths until he absorbed ~self-hatred~ and popped him out at a new space, strange enough for him to be lost with in no time after taking a few steps, with questions "What would you do now? Would you still pursue all those goals of yours? Who would inspire you now? Does this life mean anything to you anymore?" and left him hopeless. As a kid he observed many men in their youth opening these doors and found them always to be sad and depressed; he firmly decided that he would not only never open them but will never even look for their keys. Today he came to know what the keys to those doors look like. Having unlocked a new area in his mental space, he experiences a tinge of excitement generated by the new horizons instead of the expected suffering. Puzzled by this strange feeling, he begins to suffocate and finds it difficult to breathe.

# Despite all this, there is something to feel happy about, a distraction—his thoughts now broken loose are no longer rational or sequential. He has no control over them; any thought can take control over him. Compassion for the girl has distracted him from thinking about himself and axing him further. It has taken over his other thoughts, presenting him with the realization of how uncomfortable he might have made her feel. What could she possibly be going through now?

# "Sit comfortably, isn't the bag on your lap heavy? keep it aside." the lady driving the car speaks looking into the rear-view mirror.

# He places the bag aside but still sits uncomfortably, as if he is in the crowded back seat of a car, trying to give everyone space.

# "sit back and relax," the elderly man says soothingly and passes him a bottle of water

# He finds it a lot of effort to think and reason about their courtesy, so he simply obliges. 'Thank you.'

# "what track were you listening to?"

# "No space in my bag. I had to hang the headphones over my neck. I wasn't listening. The last one I listened to was Rolling Stones"

# Finally, that was the response the elderly man expected. He reaches out to the dashboard, fetches the 'Rolling Stones' cassette holder, and queries eagerly, 'Same cover?'

# "Yes"

# "Do you have any other"

# He names two other cassettes that he has and the elderly man presents the one's he has from the dashboard draw.

# "Both Same covers?"

# "same covers, yes" the young lad responds feebly
# The elderly man sighs in disappointment.

# Having surrendered to an overwhelming state of emotion, the Young Lad is completely clueless about what is happening to him. A sense of futility creeps in, as though he had missed an opportunity to reciprocate their generosity. This feeling stays bright only for a tiny moment. During this fleeting moment, it furrows his brows, casts down his eyes, and turns the corners of his lips downward, sculpting a statue out of him and then hands over the control to the emotional state he is in.

# The elderly tentatively asks her lady, "Shall I play rolling stones again?"

# "Nooo...! I am already feeling nauseous about them..."

# "Okay, how about that game, now that we are three it might be fun..."

# "No... c'mon, two or three it's not fun "

# Noticing his face has been deflated by her words she ponders while driving and pleasingly utters "you know what, let's play."

# "That's Nice! Thank you! I'll start then"

# The lady interrupts his excitement "Let me tell the rules, I will start with a piece of story and after a point will pass it to you. and you will take it to another point from there and pass it to the next person. We will continue this until we reach the climax."

# The elderly man ignores the rules as he prepares to begin "Alright, I have got an idea, I am starting." 

# The lady objects "If you start you have to pass it to him, let him take the third turn. He will get an idea"

# "I can pass it to you" the elderly man protests

# "that becomes clockwise and we decided not to play this game clockwise"

# "Alright then, go ahead but no child protagonists"

# "ohh c'mon... okay!"

# The lady exclaims and continues to drive the car for a kilometer or so

# "Once upon a time, not very long ago there lived a beautiful girl. She likes to spend her days painting and reading books without worrying about anything. One day a boy in his youth watches her paint a landscape and when a paper flies away from the stack her pet fetches it. She thanks the pet and kisses the pet playfully. The boy couldn't roll his eyes away from her. He fell in love with her. Love at first sight!"

# The elderly man setting his cap right

# "The boy walks home and drifts into sleep thinking about her. All night he dreams about her. In the morning he wakes up to realize he is in a cage of family responsibilities."

# "it's your turn"

# The young lad couldn't resist imagining himself as that boy and the girl in the story as the girl whom he fell for. He kept discarding all thoughts and ideas that he felt might give away any information about him having loved a girl and currently facing rejection. He doesn't want the world to know about it. He pitied those in their youth when he was a kid. He knew what kind of impression they had left on him.

# The elderly man turns back and impatiently says "You cannot take so much time. Only starters get to take time"

# The young lad found himself immersed in the situation, overwhelmed by feelings of timidity, unworthiness, and inadequacy. He hesitated, caught in a dilemma about whether to speak, attributing his emotions to the character he portrayed, fearful of revealing anything about himself. With nothing to say, he struggled internally. Meanwhile, the elderly man had already turned back, locking eyes with him and softly brushing off his knuckles in anticipation. The lady's attention was fixed on the rear-view mirror rather than the road ahead. Before he could assure himself that he no longer identified with those traits of timidness, having overcome his timidity and bravely confessed his feelings to the girl he liked, words began to flow out of his mouth involuntarily. His thoughts and speech had achieved such synchronization that they flowed without requiring his conscious validation before speaking.

# "The boy was raised in a conservative family, where he was brought up very rigidly. He lacked confidence and felt timid about making a move to approach her."

# The lady is disappointed with the lack of any progress in the story

# "c'mon guys the girl cannot go to him, leave alone loving him back she didn't even see him or know who he is."

# She takes a breath. "One day, the boy sees the girl again from a distance. This time, she is laughing with a handsome guy and seems to be having a good time. She probably will marry him. The boy finds himself feeling very jealous and anxious."

# That was exactly how he felt in his situation. Not that he saw her laughing and having a good time with any guy, but he had the thought of her marrying someone. He had planned many ways to approach her, along with the one he picked, and got rejected.

# "He writes a letter of love to her but him being anxious about the outcome he doesn't give any hint that it is from him." the elderly man continues

# The young lad, in fact, had written a letter of love, but he hadn't chosen that route. He jogs his memory and sees it in his drawer where he had last left it, and feels excited to have written such a beautiful letter. As the elderly man turns back, committed to the idea that he was no longer that character anymore, the young lad continues the story with the plan he had devised involving the love letter.

# "He drops the letter anonymously into her paper stack. The girl reads the letter and is impressed with it. She starts her search for him." 

# "Power of a love letter!" exclaims the elderly man to the young lad's response.

# "You guys are too cowardly to imagine! You won't evolve, and neither does the story! You want the girl to find the needle in the haystack. I'm ending this. The girl thinks the letter is from the boy she was found laughing with and secretly asserts through his friends and acquaintances that it has been written by him. Her love for him swells, and she finally marries him."

# The elderly man rushes at her, objecting firmly, "That cannot happen. There is a flaw."

# A heavy vehicle, moving slowly doesn't give her way. She honks many times.

# "There is no flaw the story had ended"

# She realizes that waiting for the truck to give them the way is futile

# "Did he and his friends lie to her that he wrote it?"

#  She maneuvers the car off the road into the mud, bouncing everyone in their seats.

# "Yes, and years later, the couple fought about it, but it didn't last for more than an hour. That is the end."

# She accelerates on the bumpy road, overtakes the truck, and merges back onto the main road.

# The lady looks frustrated and her husband understands it and goes silent.

# The silence prevails for some distance and the lady herself breaks the silence.

# "You guys are just like that heavy truck."

# No one responds. They both remain silent.

# "The only difference is you make stories immobile," she continues, hoping to lighten the tension. When they remain unresponsive, she sighs.

# "I wish I could have told you sorry," she teases gently.

# "Alright, I am sorry, guys. Speak up, say something."

# "Apology accepted" elderly man responds though his tone is still stern.

# The lady looks into the rear-view mirror at the young-lad.

# "It's okay" the young lad responds, but he doesn't know what expression he is carrying.

# She takes a deep breath, trying to dispel the tension. "Okay then, I'll take it on me. I know I have disappointed your mood. Let me try to engage you for a while. Allow me to tell a story."!

# The elderly man, still looking a bit angry but softening slightly, responds, "Go ahead."

# "A few years ago. One fine evening, he returned home from a work trip"

# "Is it a true story?" queries the young lad

# "Yes it is", she didn't like the interruption

# "So... He walked into the house, didn't eat the sweet I prepared, didn't speak anything, didn't respond to anything, walked straight into his room and shut the door. I dunno if he cried but I waited outside the door with my receptors tuned to hear a cry. I think I heard something which he later denied. Checked if he is okay and he replied that he is but his voice didn't sound so."

# As she says that her eyes roll toward her husband and his eyes roll toward her but with her driving, they miss making the eye contact. 

# "Determined, and scared for him I woke him up and served him dinner, I watched over him till he finished his dinner, he didn't speak a word and later he went back to sleep. That whole night I couldn't sleep. I prayed for him to have the ability to get over it quickly. My thoughts wandered around a similar incident where I think he was as sad as he was that evening".

# "It was the day he proposed to me and the day I refused his proposal. I didn't directly know how sad he was that day, but the words I told him could have made anyone feel sad. He was likely sad all that night too, I think. I thought he might feel better tonight, at least having had a similar incident to relate to. But the night I refused his proposal, he didn't have any previous experience to cling to and think, 'This will pass too, like the last time.' I was concerned for him. Like I said, I was wandering over that past incident, maybe to find something that would give some hope that he would be relieved soon.

# He saw me at a classical dance event—well, I wasn't dancing; I was in the audience like him. He followed me to my house, but that day he did not have the courage to talk to me, so he went back to his city. He later told me that he couldn't stop thinking about me, and the more he thought about me, the more my image formed in his mind and made him anxious. He tried to avoid being anxious, and naturally, as days passed, the image started to fade. He got scared, and that's when he decided to be brave and travel out of the city to meet me. He did not start immediately. He was naive, timid, and lacked confidence. He set himself a few unrealistic goals, and maybe he thought if he accomplished them, I would accept him. To this day, I still feel that idea was superstitious."

# Something rang in the young guy's head; it rang as soon as the narration started, but when he heard about the rejection, the intensity and volume of the ring increased. He began to defend, saying, "What's superstitious about it?"

# The lady replied, exchanging a glance with her husband, and the young lad noticed it. "The activities he had set for himself had nothing to do with meeting me or requesting me to accept him into my life."

# The young lad thought he was still contemplating whether to protest, but the words came out, "But it gave him strength, confidence, and courage to meet you, didn't it?"

# The lady countered, "How is running daily related to gaining confidence to talk to me? Is he going to be talking to me about running?"

# The young guy immediately reckoned with his words because that was exactly what he did in his situation. He did those and many other superstitious activities to gain confidence before he went on to meet the girl he had seen a month ago on his vacation. Now, he was in the car after the rejection. A sense of doubt crept in, wondering how this lady knew what had happened with him, and it started to brew. The young lad ignored the suspicion, unaware that it was brewing, as he was busy recollecting how he had blamed himself for setting those unrealistic goals and going ahead to meet the girl without accomplishing them as he waited for the ride.

# The lady continued, "He came to my place and was nervous. He told me that he had seen me in the audience and very soon after, that he liked me very much and proposed to me. I had no such plans; I didn't care who he was and bluntly said no. In fact, I was rude, and I left. He followed me and told me that he never thought he would propose to anyone with the kind of personality he had, but it was his love for me that gave him that courage. I just looked at his eyes—they were already filled with the pain of rejection, but his face covered it with a tiny smile. But I didn't say anything back. I left, leaving him there. I thought I left, but I didn't realize I left with that image of his."

# “The young man thought to himself, ‘I’ve said that too. How old is my thought process, and are my ideas ancient? Even if their experiences mirror mine, the expression cannot be identical.’ He could imagine himself with the same expression after the rejection. ‘How did they know all this? Did my face reveal a similar expression when I boarded this car, and are they constructing the story to match that expression? There’s no chance they know it; are they reading my mind?’ He wanted to say, ‘Please do not read my mind.’ But he lacked any evidence that they were indeed reading his thoughts and not merely narrating their own story. He didn’t want to make a fool of himself. It hurts. ‘Do we share the same stories? They won’t believe me if I say so, and they might perceive me as pretentious.’ But how on earth do they know my story?” he cried out loud within himself, without making a sound. He was angry with them. ‘They shouldn’t be doing this. I have never witnessed such a phenomenon. How are they able to do it? Why can’t my mind stop thinking about the rejection? It’s very insulting to let others know that I was rejected. I have to stop thinking about it.’ He felt bullied, as if they were asserting their superiority over him. ‘They are the car owners; they don’t want a stranger to assert superiority in their car. Where is my head traveling?’"

# A signboard appears, and the husband reads aloud, “180 kms to **[destination]**.”

# At the serendipitous intersection of his own musing—where is my head traveling?—and the husband’s announcement, the young man exclaims and murmurs in exhaustion, “Again! You’re reading even this thought.”

# “Let’s take a halt; I’m feeling tired,” the husband suggests, and the young guy screams within himself, his frustration reaching a crescendo.

# As he steps out of the car and walks to a table with the couple, the young man’s mind races with queries and numerous hypotheses, attempting to justify how they seem to be pulling off this eerie narrative coincidence. Seated around the table, he is lost in himself, gathering the courage to question them without sounding stupid. He has to be roused by them to place his food order with the waiter. Finding it embarrassing and an opportunity lost to question them about how they are masquerading his story as their own, he is worried and takes a sip of water from a glass. As he sips, a strange childhood memory surfaces—a memory of when he won the quiz competition for his team back in class IX. The stakes were high: if they answered correctly, they would win by 5 points, but a wrong answer would mean losing the competition by 10 points. Passing would still result in a loss by 5 points. The question was, ‘When is World’s Human Rights Day?’ He didn’t know the answer, nor did his team, but as the clock ticked, he stood up and declared, ‘December 10th.’ His teammates pulled him down, scolding him—that’s when, after a brief moment of suspense, the quiz master awarded them 10 points. Though he lied to his teammates later, claiming he had read it in newspapers, he didn’t actually know the answer; it had just come to him.

# “He began to question how he had managed to answer correctly, but no answer came. ‘Was it an insinuation from someone who knew? Could it be telepathy, good karma, some cosmic energy, or did I somehow read the quiz master’s mind?’ Many theories presented themselves as possible explanations. It was a moment reminiscent of Helen Keller’s experience when she was accused of plagiarism, a story he knew well from ‘The Story of My Life’—the only book he had ever read, gifted to him by his mother for his birthday. He retraced his memory just as she had, searching for the source of his knowledge. ‘I am scared,’ he thought. No rationale seemed to fit what was happening to him. Had the rejection shattered his protective shell, ushering in a new phase? He felt exposed, as if the couple were stripping him bare. ‘Has it always been like this, and I’m only now realizing it? Or has something within me broken, making my thoughts visible for all to read? Can I ever return to the person I was before? I hate this.’ He searched for inspiring stories from his past to lift his spirits, but none seemed relevant to his current ordeal. He felt like he was unraveling. He screamed silently. The urge to cry was strong, but he held back, honoring a promise he had made to himself. After washing his face, he engaged in a disjointed self-dialogue, flipping each worrisome thought into a more convenient perspective. Suddenly, he was filled with an inexplicable energy and excitement. With that newfound resolve, he began to eat and reinforced the ideas that had emerged from this mental reorientation.”

# The young man re-entered the car alongside them, invigorated with a newfound energy, and they set off once more.

# “Well, a cheerful smile while tears rolled down his eyes—that’s the image I carried back home with me. Nothing bothered me until the point when all of this proposal business suddenly hit me,” she recounted.

# “She has some impressive memory,” the young man mused to himself, having expected her to need some time or a prompt to pick up where she left off. “As I closed my eyes, that image of his face appeared; it was just as it had been when it all ended. I rose quickly.”

# With a sense of resignation, the young man let his shoulders fall.

# “Like he knew where I could be found, I did not. The image of him kept visiting me; it started with naive innocence and later developed—or perhaps I fantasized it—into many such expressions, gauging his character and loving him more. I waited for him to reach out to me again. I knew he wouldn’t reach out to me directly after the way I rejected him. But at the classical event where he said he had seen me for the first time, he could come there to have a glance at me and still have a rational explanation for his presence. I made sure I was there every time there was an event; I had to attend for five weeks to catch a glimpse of him. As I set my eyes on him, he was already looking at me. All his fear had transformed into excitement within me. I rushed towards him, and he began to walk away. I drew close to him.”

# “That’s when I understood the depth of the impact I had on him that day—the loss of someone dearly loved,” she reflected.

# “And this is the night I saw him with that similar and intense feeling,” she concluded.

# Her story seeded a flicker of hope in the young man, yet it arrived at a precarious time. The nascent hope began to puncture the bubble he had meticulously crafted, turning every worrisome thought to his favor. With the shadow of doubt looming, he was resolute, exerting every effort to maintain the bubble’s integrity, to forestall its rupture and the potential dissolution of the tenuous serenity he had achieved.

# “For a moment, I wondered what would have happened to him if I had never met him again, but it was no time for ‘ifs’ and ‘buts.’ I met him, and we were both happy. He should be able to cling to this event and be hopeful.”

# The young lad’s hope fluctuated but was restored.

# They spotted a tall old man, seemingly older than all three, at a distance, signaling for a ride. The lady suggested, “I am thinking of stopping for him; you may have to take the backseat?”

# “I am fine with that; I wouldn’t mind,” he replied.

# They pulled over, and the old man climbed in with his travel bag, and together, they resumed their journey.

# “Let’s continue the story,” the husband prompted from the backseat, as if sensing the young man’s curiosity.

# “We’re in the middle of a story—I mean, I am telling them a story,” she clarified.

# “Do you want to listen?” she asked the old man.

# He remained silent, his face etched with confusion, but she took it as consent and proceeded.

# “Well, you haven’t missed much. One day, my husband came home, he is sad and depressed. His emotions so loud on his face, a sight from 20 years ago. It took me three days to coax out what had happened. Finally, he revealed that he had lost his most cherished possession—the manuscript of his novel. Though the idea had been with him for the past 23 years, he had never felt as close to it as he had in the last 7 years before its loss.”

# The young man, relieved that the story didn’t mirror his own, pondered the significance of the numbers ‘7’ and ‘23.’ His gaze drifted to the old man, whose head had drooped, and who turned towards the lady with a faint smile that failed to mask a hint of guilt. “Are they weaving him into their story now?” he wondered.

# The lady continued, “He kept all the pain to himself, never speaking out. I assumed he might be going through a lot of pain and would eventually get over it, but he never tried. He started to feel guilty.”

# The young man observed the old man’s reaction to the story and murmured, “This couple are serial readers.”

# The lady went on, “He blamed himself for his carelessness, for the useless values he had clung to, like not having written his name or address on the manuscript.”

# The old man appeared uncomfortable.

# The young lad’s thoughts raced investigatively. “What could be the old man’s story? Reading mine was simple because love is common, but not all are writers, and this old man doesn’t look like one. What could he have lost? What else could one have for 23 years and be close to for 7 years? That is the key. No doubt they are reading his story. A pet? No, not for 23 years. A loss, but what kind? Death? If so, who could it be? He is alone, probably his wife?” His imagination rushed to a graveyard. “That’s sensitive, even for me to think about. How are they doing it?” Frightened by the thoughts he was encountering, he put his deductions to rest and quickly caught up with the narration.

# “He couldn’t come out of it and resorted to alcohol to forget. I gave him time to realize that alcohol wouldn’t help but would only bring more and new problems. He soon started to blame his memory, which didn’t help him answer the question about how the book started. Soon after he lost his manuscript on the train, four kids who found it reached out to him, but when he claimed it as his, the kids expected an answer about how the book starts. Despite not being able to prove he was the author, he left an impression of a thief with them.”

# “His wife could have been sick, and he might have exhibited negligence in taking care of her. That’s why, burdened with guilt, he became an alcoholic. I am jumping to conclusions; I won’t approve of it. If I speak now, I will not only sound stupid but could hurt others’ feelings and sentiments.” The young lad hated his speculative deductions about the old man.

# “One day, I took it seriously, forced him to shower, groomed him, dressed him in new clothes, and dropped him at the library. I asked him not to drink that day to see the difference, I asked him to try. That day was hard for him, but towards the end, he found a pamphlet on the library’s lost and found notice board that read, ‘We have found a manuscript of a novel on the train. If you think it is yours, please call us.’ He dialed the number but couldn’t answer the questions posed to verify his authenticity. He started to believe he was losing his memory. To forget that he was losing his memory, he returned to drinking. The memory loss slowly started to become real for him. With him like that and me worrying for him, our home fell to nothing. I decided to take him to rehab, and he joined, but he couldn’t stay for more than a week. On one of my visits, he cried to be taken away. I felt sad and brought him home. I decided I would treat him myself with whatever he was facing, by showing a little more love.”

# The young lad’s mind was a whirlwind of thoughts and suspicions, each more unsettling than the last. He had told himself sternly, “Don’t mislead me, stop making noise,” as if scolding his own mind would silence the theories it spun about the old man. “He is guilty of his mistake. Do you know what mistake he made? His negligent behavior allowed him to give one medication for another. He overdosed her. He is guilty of it, and someone helped him with the rehab.”

# “That seemed to have worked, and here he is,” the lady concluded.

# The young lad yearned for confirmation—had she read out his story? The only way to know for sure was to see if she had read the old man’s story by matching his deductions.

# “I will get down here,” the old man announced.

# The lady pulled over the car slowly.

# “Thank you very much, you sound just like my daughter, though she is younger than you.”

# “You see, the daughter must have helped him overcome the grief,” the young lad thought, but that deduction wasn’t enough. He toyed with the idea of getting down there with the old man and was almost convinced to do so.

# The lady, pleased, suggested, “Let’s have a cup of coffee.”

# “Sure,” the old man agreed.

# They all disembarked. The young lad was now brimming with questions. He sought a private moment with the old man before rejoining the couple in the car. He insisted on carrying the old man’s bag into the coffee shop.

# Walking together behind the couple into the cafe, the young lad asked, “Where are you traveling from?”

# “My daughter’s house to my house,” the old man replied.

# The young lad probed further, “You must be attending some function of relatives?”

# “No, I have been staying at her place for the past three months. I kind of missed home, so I came.”

# “I can see that excitement. You’re not taking your wife and daughter with you?”

# “I have been living alone for the past 2 years after my wife passed away,” the old man revealed.

# The young lad’s curiosity intensified, but he tempered his excitement, realizing the sensitivity of the topic.

# “I am sorry,” he offered.

# “Thank you!” the old man responded, then lightened the mood, “Well, the disease needs to be sorry.”

# “Did she suffer long?” the young lad inquired.

# “She suffered for 7 years. I should have taken better care of her,” the old man confessed.

# The young lad, upon hearing ‘7 years,’ was eager to confirm if their marriage had lasted for 23 years. He carefully phrased his question to be respectful.

# “Well, I have gone through that phase, and it’s over now. I stay with my daughter; she takes care of me. I went into a depression like that fellow,” the old man said, pointing towards the elderly man.

# The young lad, driven by his deductions, was tempted to ask if the old man had accidentally overdosed his wife. Fearful that his thoughts might betray him, he cautiously asked, “If I may ask… How many years were you together in marriage?”

# “23, but I only understood her importance in those last 7 years of her suffering,” the old man answered.

# The young lad’s anxiety peaked, trembling at the thought that his hypothesis—that they were narrating the passengers’ stories as their own—might be true.

# “Please don’t mind me saying this, but I think you should be careful.”

# “Careful?! Did I do something wrong?”

# “No, you didn’t do anything wrong, but your past is vulnerable, just like mine.”

# “What do you mean?” the old man asked, puzzled.

# “She read out your story, substituting your loss with their loss of the book. It’s not fair.”

# “Did she?”

# “Yes, she did. She even mentioned the numbers 23 and 7, which were the exact years your marriage with your wife lasted and the years you were close to her. The couple are serial readers.”

# “Maybe it’s a coincidence.”

# “It can’t be a coincidence. The numbers 23 and 7 were accurate, and you were feeling guilty about…” He caught himself before he could finish the thought. After a pause, he continued, “Earlier, they told their love story, and it perfectly matched mine. Now yours matched too.”

# “Now that I think about it, I did wonder if they were talking about me during the part where he got addicted and went to rehab. But in my case, when I was in rehab, there were many people there with a past similar to mine.”

# “Maybe, but what if they never lost a book, nor were they in love? What if they’re just reading our minds?”

# The old man laughed cautiously. “At this age, I don’t think I would mind if they have read my mind or not. I have nothing to lose. It’s all in my head, and I am constantly dealing with it. The only thing I might worry about is some stranger getting to know about it. I’m not someone who hides from his mistakes. If I’ve done something wrong, I’d just tell them what I’ve told myself. Back in my adulthood, I too was worried about this phenomenon of people reading my mind and mocking my errors. I couldn’t handle it. I tried thinking loudly about random stuff so that they’d fall into the trap of reading them, if they were at all. I tried to see myself from an eagle’s eye view, considering the weather, the situation, the context, what I was wearing, what I was representing. I observed how my past influenced the decisions my friends and I made as a group. It takes a lot of energy, and it was difficult to always be situationally aware. I guess with time, I stopped worrying about that phenomenon and let myself go. Maybe I was a bit older than you are now, back then. If I have to think along the lines of your hypothesis, I see that the story was finished so quickly, almost exactly when we arrived at my drop-off location, because my mind was constantly thinking about how much distance was left. I’m visiting my home after a long time. Maybe she tuned into my thoughts of rush. Maybe that rush was part of the narration that led her to finish the story quickly, precisely at the location where I wanted to get down. To feel better about it, I adjusted or convinced myself to believe that it happens, no matter what.”

# “People do it for many reasons. In this context, it seems harmless. I saw nothing more than an attempt to make the listener feel better. But there are worse instances where they extract secrets and exercise superiority.”

# “I know not everyone wants to be open about their past, but be aware of the situation and try not to get lost.”

# They joined the couple for coffee. While having coffee, the young lad was unaware that he was sternly looking at the couple. He was worried, thinking about how dangerous this phenomenon could be, and he believed it was morally wrong to invade others’ privacy, no matter the context. He wanted to let the couple know this.

# They left the old man and started their journey. The young lad found some relief that the thought of the girl and the rejection hadn’t occurred to him for a long time. But soon, like the elderly man from the story his wife told, and as it once happened to him, he couldn’t form her image in his head and became worried. He tried to recollect the moment he first saw her, and the image slowly formed. As it formed, he didn’t feel much pain from the fact he got rejected.

# “Do you want to take the shotgun?”

# This brought the young lad back to his senses about what he needed to do. He wanted to let them know what they were doing was wrong, but he had nothing to back him up to say it. He tried to say it indirectly, if not directly.

# The young lad, still wary of confronting their morality, crafted an indirect question: “I have a question. Let’s say two people are having a duel. Would it be moral for one person to acquire all the powers of another and use them against that person?”

# Unaware of his disillusionment and proud of his subtlety, he observed their puzzled expressions, interpreting them as a sign that he had caught them off guard.

# “The last time I was as puzzled as I am now was when I turned on the wipers instead of the headlights,” one of them remarked, seemingly deflecting the question with humor.

# “Honestly, how can one gain the powers of another, let alone use them against the person?” they pondered.

# The young lad silently congratulated himself, thinking, “That’s how you trap someone with a question; they cannot escape now.” He felt each response tightened the trap.

# “You must have seen such scenarios in mythological movies,” he suggested.

# “I guess, but when one takes over the powers of another and uses them against the original owner, it demeans the fight between two superpowers,” they replied.

# His excitement peaked, hands trembling and voice quivering, “So you agree it’s bad?”

# “Good or bad, it kills the entertainment,” they responded.

# The young lad insisted, “Yes, it kills, and it’s bad.”

# He noticed his hands shaking uncontrollably and comforted himself, thinking this must be what courage feels like.

# They soon encountered a middle-aged man who appeared to be a reporter, based on his attire and demeanor. After he hopped into the front seat, the reporter immediately began transferring notes from a scribble pad to a notebook, drawing the silent attention of the others. The young lad, momentarily abandoning his moral stance, secretly hoped the couple would unsettle the reporter as they had done to him.

# Once the reporter finished his work, he apologized, “I’m sorry, I’m caught up in a very important thing.” He then asked if they had seen the movie “It’s Unpublished Yet!”

# “No, we don’t watch movies,” the lady replied, glancing at the young lad.

# “I was busy; I didn’t know a movie like that had come out,” the young lad added.

# “It’s based on a newspaper article I wrote,” the reporter revealed.

# They didn’t seem to have accepted his apology for being discourteous, and the idea to congratulate him didn’t cross their minds.

# The lady affirmed, “So, you are a reporter?”

# “Yes, I am. It’s about four kids who found a nameless manuscript on a train.”

# “They decide to find the author and give it to him,” all three, the young lad and the couple, said in chorus.

# “You people have seen the movie,” the reporter said playfully.

# “No, we haven’t.”

# “Then you must have read the article,” the reporter was now skeptical.

# “But it appeared in a newspaper with not many readers.”

# “No, we haven’t read it either.”

# “Then how come you know about it?” the reporter was unquestionably curious now, and the chorus continued mockingly and teasingly.

# “They get off the train and travel back, sticking it at every library,” the chorus continued.

# “Someone who read the article or watched the movie must have told you.”

# “No, you won’t be able to guess it. They ask questions to everyone who claims the manuscript as theirs.”

# “But how? I don’t know what’s happening here!” the reporter went fuzzy.

# The elderly man started, “Because I am the author of it, the one who lost it.”

# The reporter overlapped him, “Okay, come on now! You won’t be able to know this information which I am about to say because I myself just found out about it. They found the author; some lady called the kids up, and her answers matched 68%, so they decided to give it to her.”

# The lady turned her head and looked at her husband.

# “Now don’t say a thing. Ignore it like he did. Finally, the book is going to see the light of day,” the lady exclaimed.

# As the young lad observed, the old man struggled to stop himself from saying anything. “Yes, we don’t know,” the old man said happily.

# “I am sorry to have interrupted you. What were you saying?” the reporter asked the elderly man.

# “Forget about it. The book already took a long time to see the light; now we don’t want to block it any further.”

# “What do you mean, you don’t want to block it any further?”

# “Nothing,” the lady interjected, trying to distract the reporter from the topic. “He is talking about the book we wrote. It is based on how we journeyed through after he lost his dear thing.”

# “Do you write?”

# “Yes, we wrote it together,” that brought a smile to the elderly man’s face.

# “Look at how happy he and we are now.”

# The young lad thought he would have never let the book or something dear to one slip away so simply for seven years. He thought, “I would have tried at least. Is it so simple and easy to let go of something that is so dear to one?” and he started to think about the girl and questioned, “Will I be able to let go of my feelings for her so easily?” and answered it, “Maybe I can try if I want to.”

# “Can I read it?” the reporter asked the lady.

# “It is unpublished yet!”

# “Don’t lose it; not every child is as crazy as those four kids to get it back,” the reporter laughed.

# “We have taken care of it; we have our postal address and telephone number on it.”

# “Learned from our mistake,” said the elderly man.

# The lady quickly turned back to him and spoke to the reporter, distracting him from the puzzle he had gathered.

# “Give us your contact; we will post it to you once it’s done.”

# “That helps,” the reporter said.

# The reporter went into the bag and fetched a card, passing it to the lady. He felt some cassettes in his bag.

# “Do you guys want to listen to some music? I have a few cassettes,” the reporter offered.

# “What cassettes do you have?” the elderly man inquired.

# As the reporter named them, the elderly man sighed in relief. “Finally, someone is going to reintroduce us to some long-forgotten songs.”

# The young lad looked around; his stop was nearing. As the reporter played a cassette, the young lad became statue-still, enveloped by the music.

# The song began, and everyone joined in the lyrics except for the young lad. The elderly man beside him invited him to join the chorus, and the young lad hesitantly obliged. As they sang together, the young lad’s spirits lifted. Thoughts of her occasionally zoned him out, but he began to feel hopeful. Perhaps it was the couple’s story instilling hope, or maybe they were simply reflecting his own story back at him with added optimism. The old man, moving to the tune and humming loudly, tapped the young lad’s shoulder, encouraging him to groove along. The young lad rejoined the singing and dancing, enjoying the ride.

# “In two songs, we’ll reach my stop,” the young lad announced, continuing to hum.

# “Coffee time,” the couple chimed in, still humming.

# After the song, they stopped the music. The reporter mentioned he had to hurry, but the couple insisted he stay, and he acquiesced.

# They drank coffee and conversed. The lady found the coffee too hot to sip. “Don’t be nervous,” she said. “You reminded me of him 20 years ago when he first came to meet me. Are you like him? Do you have any such stories?”

# The young lad was surprised and relieved they hadn’t read his thoughts aloud.

# “I think I have one, but your story was great. I enjoyed it,” he said.

# “I guess each of you contributed to it. I was jumping onto all the new thoughts that sparked, only to make it engaging. I hope I didn’t offend you or come across as intrusive.”

# The young lad’s thoughts were pronounced, but he hesitated and refrained from mentioning them, instead saying, “It was a good time.”

# The young lad apologized for insisting to answer his duel question in his favor, and that got every one laughing.

# They wished each other well and parted ways.

# The young lad approached the elderly man. “What would you have done if she never looked back at you?”

# The elderly man replied, “I had already made up my mind to have one last glance at her face for my memory and then stop seeing her. But who knows? I might have lost myself as I did when I lost the manuscript. Without her by my side, I may have never found myself again. Now that I think about it, all it takes is a try.”

# A melancholic smile surfaced on the young lad’s face, and they waved goodbye.

# The car drove away, and the young lad walked down a lane from the highway. Thoughts of her and the rejection visited him, but they no longer bothered him. Surprisingly, he had attained a sense of objectivity over it.

# Humming the lyrics, he walked on the road flanked by trees, amidst the sound of the wind. The whirring sound of a car intensified and then slowly faded as he neared his home.
