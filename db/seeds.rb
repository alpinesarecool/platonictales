  She clocked out of her office and rushed to her moped in the parking lot. She tied her hair into a bun, wore a helmet, tucked the loose end of her saree into her waist, and drove away. A green-coloured saree with an off-white coloured blouse was the dress code at her workplace. Driving on an empty road with trees on either side, she navigated all the distractions and carefully contemplated her next steps to win the daily evening game at home.

"It isn't a win until he agrees. We are totally in the lead, but who knows, he might try to pull a sneaky move. I am sure he wouldn't have any planned move, and we shouldn't be too competitive and lose ideas to him like we did with the 'labelling the sock' argument. Let's play dumb and let him figure out his moves. So you will be playing a naive housewife but don't be too naive to fall into his trap. I also think we should add more depth to the character."

She loosened her hand on the accelerator, drifted into the side lane, and drove slowly, pondering over it.

"Remember that housewife from our recent bank visit? Despite her documents being perfect, the bank people kept her waiting and raised doubts about her documents, expecting a commission. But she was kind, pleasing, and patient. She never lost her temper arguing about her rights but spent her waiting time as if she owned all the time in the world, helping old people with their forms. Finally, it was the bank people who were moved down to her and processed her loan. Let's play her. I think perseverance with kindness and a pleasing attitude would add a little depth to the character."

She moved back, tilted her head a bit, and got a look at herself in the moped's rearview mirror with a smile of joy. A cool breeze brushed her cheek, broadening the smile on her face and amplifying her delight. All the excitement she had held at higher altitudes until then flew in, blinded her restraint and overwhelmed her to anticipate the ideas to act on after winning.

"The photograph should suggest him waiting at a bus stop with all public transport called for a protest. His rest face photograph could be used to replace all the numbers on the clock. Should I click a joyful face of his in an urban landscape or a gloomy face of his in a small town landscape?" Her vehicle bounced over a speed bump a few streets from his office building, causing a sudden jolt that dampened her excitement and set her ideas aside.

"I have a question," the character she designed asked innocently. "How is my character going to help you achieve victory? We are not suggesting anything through my character related to our side of the argument: living experience in bigger cities is better than in a small town."

"That part of the argument is over if you remember. Oh! you wouldn't possibly know it since you were just created. I’ve designed a few other characters and used them to address that issue, and we’ve successfully proven that living experience in bigger cities is better. It’s just that he couldn’t accept the defeat," she explained to her character as she neared his office.

She parked her vehicle in the visitor's parking area, which was filled with women waiting for their fathers, brothers, or husbands to pick them up. Gathering her excitement, she walked toward the security guard. He was occupied with ensuring the safety of the waiting women but smiled as she approached him.

"Sir said he might take some time."

"Is the manager around?"

"Yes, they're in a meeting. He asked you to go ahead."

"Never mind, I'll wait."

She walked back to her moped and waited with the other women. Her character-in-training said, "This is our chance. We should go home and prepare his favourite snack before he arrives."

"That's an unexpectedly good idea," she agreed, beginning to tie her hair into a bun.

"Weren’t we supposed to be kind?" the character asked.

"Yes, of course we are."

"Then, let’s leave the moped for him and take the bus."

"You’re not supposed to cause me pain. You’re getting too into character, but anyway..."

"You know what, since you’ve decided to sacrifice the moped, he’ll be considering ways to reciprocate. Let’s steer his thoughts so that we come out on top."

"But how?"

"Let’s write a note asking if we should pack our bags and pass it to him along with the keys."

"Isn’t that a bit too persuasive?"

"I’m being strategic and hinting at what I want in return. It’s still up to him to decide."

"If I get his photo framed on the wall, the credit will go to you."

"You are my creator who designed me."

She wrote a note that read, "Shall I pack our bags?" and handed it to the security guard along with the moped's key. "Please pass these to him, and don’t read it. Also, let him know that I took the bus."

She slipped the ticket into one compartment filled with similar tickets and the coins into another. Then she put on her headphones, plugged the jack into her Walkman, flipped the cassette, and tuned into "A Boy Named Sue" by Johnny Cash. On the bus, she sat by the window, lost in the music, and gazed out at the streets with a serene smile.

The same cassette was being played. Changed into her pyjamas, she was occupied preparing his favourite snack. This time, the music came from the tape recorder and the large speakers. The speakers were in the four corners of the main hall's wall, and the tape recorder rested on the centre table. The wall was filled with portraits of them. They included a photograph of two arms stretched out and giving a fist pump, both arms wearing toilet paper rolls like bangles, with the toilet paper rolled over from one arm and rolled under from the other; a photograph of him crouched inside a fridge holding ketchup bottles in his hands; and a photograph of her, tired from labelling socks with a thread and needle, with a pile of socks in front of her to be labelled, among many others.
The same cassette played on as she changed into her pyjamas and focused on preparing his favourite snack. This time, the music came from the tape recorder and large speakers. The speakers were positioned in the four corners of the main hall, and the tape recorder rested on the centre table. The walls were adorned with portraits of them. Among the photographs were two arms stretched out and giving a fist pump, both arms wearing toilet paper rolls like bangles—one roll wrapped from above and the other from below; another of him crouched inside a fridge, holding ketchup bottles; and a tired image of her holding a sock labelled "L," surrounded by a pile of socks yet to be labelled, with a thread and needle in the other hand.

She sang along, adjusting her pitch until the highs and lows were balanced and the sound was pleasing. Once she achieved the right tone, she patted herself on the back.

"Yes! Well done, baby. You deserve a coffee for this. That’s the voice we need. It’s going to melt him like ice cream, and we’re going to frame him today."

She made her a coffee, picked up the current read from the rack, and walked out to the balcony. She noticed that her balcony garden was dry and in need of water. She paused as the coffee cup neared her lips.

"You need some patience training too. Remember, you’re a woman who can read a book while having your coffee at a cool temperature, but you can't focus on your book if you’re distracted by the thought of not watering the plants."

She sipped the coffee and found it pleasantly hot enough to continue reading. She turned to the bookmarked page and discovered a note which read, "I hope my argument from last night has convinced you." Instinctively, the newly designed character exclaimed in a distorted voice, "I bet! He has similar expectations too!"

“You’re breaking your tone and pitch. Don’t panic! You have a job ahead of you tonight!” Clearing her pitch, the pleasing voice suggested, “Ohh! Alright, let’s use the snack as an element of surprise.”

She agreed, saying, “That can surely help, but I don’t know how at this moment.”

She paused and resumed her reading several times, reassuring the pleasing character, who had turned nervous, that their note would have a similar effect on him.

The knock on the door broke her perpetual thoughts. She got up, placed the book back in the rack, ensuring it looked like it had never been opened, and then answered the door. He entered, his eyes immediately scanning the balcony, only to find a lone coffee cup, much to his dismay. She took his bag, waited for him to hand over the lunch box hanging from his other shoulder, and watched his face closely for any sign of disappointment, which briefly flashed before quickly fading away.

"Hello, sir, good evening! How was your day? Would you like anything?" she asked.

"The man was caught off guard by the overwhelming and unexpected hospitality but played along. 'Good evening! It was a great day, thanks for asking. Maybe a glass of water.'"

She walked into the kitchen to fetch water. "What were you doing? I thought we had found the balance. Why were you exaggerating? And why did you have to use 'sir'?"

"Did I overdo it?" asked the pleasing voice, its pitch rising.

"I’m sorry," the pleasing voice apologized, sounding distressed.

Astonished by the sensitivity of the character she designed, she said, "Nah! Nah! Nah! You did a great job. It’s always a good idea to offer your husband some water."

"Thank you!" the pleasing voice responded, regaining its balanced tone.

"Perfect! That’s the tuned voice... stick to it. But you know what? You should be a bit stronger."

She waited for him to move his shoes to the rack and then handed him the glass of water. As he drank, she fidgeted impatiently, eager to hear his thoughts. She wasn’t prepared for disappointment. With her eyes tightly shut, she peeked out through one eye and asked, "Shall I pack the bags?"

He tried to keep his soiled hands from touching his mouth, which was agape in surprise. "I thought my words from last night had convinced you."

"Shall I fetch more water?" she asked, ignoring his words as if he hadn’t spoken.

"I'm good, thank you."

"You were saying something?" she prompted.

"I assumed I convinced you last night."

"About last night... your words put me to sleep. My apologies for saying that."

Unable to handle the truth delivered in such a pleasing tone, the man fell silent.

"I’ve prepared your favourite snack, so please tidy up."

She walked away with the glass, and the pleasing voice was praised all the way. "Timely move! Just when he became speechless, you presented him with the surprise. Now we’re not encouraging anything from last night."
"I’m upset; he didn’t thank us for leaving the moped for him," the pleasing voice said, struggling to maintain the tone.

"Don't show it. He owes us one, which gives us the advantage to influence him about packing the bags."

He made sure she went inside and then stealthily approached the book rack. He picked up her current read and noticed that the bookmark and the note he had left were six pages apart. He pulled out a small note from his shirt pocket and checked the page number he had noted when placing the note. Neither the bookmark nor the note was on the correct page. A smile briefly flashed across his face before disappearing as he heard her approaching. He quickly returned the book to its place and went into his room.

He gathered the snack into two bowls, offered one to her, and sat opposite her on the balcony. After taking a spoonful of the snack and being blown away by the taste, he reached into his pocket and pulled out two brightly coloured slips. "I got movie tickets for tonight," he said.

She turned away uncharacteristically as she scooped up the snack with her spoon. "Come on, movies? You know they're as stale as my life in this small town."

"We agreed not to show our anger," she reminded the character with a pleasing voice, speaking softly.

"It wasn’t rude; I said it very politely," the pleasing voice defended.

"Yes, but you were angry and made our point clear."

"Did I?"

"Yes, indeed! 'Stale as my life in this small town,'" she pointed out to the character. "Speak in a soft tone, and don’t let those thou...ggts..."

He interrupted her, having recovered from the disconcerting experience of her reaction to his planned surprise. "You like adventures; this is an adventure film about four teens."

"I sure do like them, but not anymore," her tone had softened.

"This movie will be close to your childhood favourite author, Enid Blyton."

"I doubt eeet..." she began cautiously, realizing her earlier tone might have sounded rude, "will it offer anything new?"

"It will, I’m sure it will, because it’s based on a true story."

"What truth did the teens uncover?"

"Caught you! Wee...hoo! That’s something to be watched in the movie."

"You said it’s a true story? The facts must already be out there."

"Yes! Why not save your curiosity for the cinema?"

She may not have realized how intently she was looking into his eyes, demanding an answer, but he noticed.

"Well... well... I know you can’t resist—four teens found a nameless manuscript on a train while returning from their vacation. They embark on an adventure to find its rightful author."

"This story doesn’t seem like it would become famous. How did the makers even find out about it?" Before he could answer, she interjected, "Did they plaster pamphlets everywhere to get attention?"

He struggled to withhold giving her any credit for that guess, but his head involuntarily nodded, with his lower lip jutting out in amazement. "Yes! Someone published a news article covering it, titled 'It's Unpublished Yet!'"

"You see... how predictable it is. That could bore me. I feel the same about our lives—life here is predictable and boring. Nothing new or exciting ever happens, and everything remains static. That’s why moving to a bigger city is so appealing."

"He stared blankly at her, processing what she said, and broke the silence. 'I don’t see how predictability in movies relates to life in a small town.'"

“It is. My life here is predictable and boring, just like a movie that is too predictable.”

“No, come on, that doesn’t make sense. Think about nostalgia. It can remind you of the days when you visited your grandmother, crossing the streams with your 'Famous Five' book in your bag.”

“Ahh, nostalgia. That’s all movies and small towns can ever offer. It’s so overrated and keeps me occupied, making me dwell on what I did this day last week, last year, and soon, in the future, I’ll be reminiscing about what I did on this day a year ago, telling myself I was having the very same thought. It feels like I’m just ageing with the same memories. Nostalgia has a way of making me forget about the surprises I’m missing out on in bigger cities. I’m missing them.”

This made him perplexed. "I see some great ideas developing in your statement, but only a part of it made sense to me. I see great potential in your point"

"You like my argument," she said excitedly.

"Yes, but it seems like it's still in its early stages."

Staring at him, she tried to look at her idea sharply. "You know what? Let's go to the movies. I think I can refine it and make it clearer by the time the movie is over."

"Sure, I want to listen to it. I like listening to you."

Both of them joined in the kitchen to cook dinner. He chopped the vegetables while she consulted the recipe guide, waiting for the pan to heat up. After setting the guide aside, she checked the pan with her palm and determined it needed a little more time.

“How did you like that character? Did she annoy you?” she chuckled.

“I wish she had just annoyed me; she actually scared me. She was so pleasing and had a lot of expectations. I felt like she was demanding politeness, and I could sense her anger simmering beneath the surface. I was playing a sophisticated guy with deep pockets, so getting angry wasn’t an option. I was provoked, but I don’t think my character knew how to be angry and sound sweet at the same time. I think tolerance was the best choice for my character.”

"True! I couldn't agree more. Her approach was provocative, and the sad part is, she didn't even realize it. Even if she had, she wouldn't have admitted it. She was blinded by her conviction, thinking she was doing the right thing. She must have given you a hell of a ride."

"Yes, she did! But what did my character come across as?"

"Did you have anything in mind about your character apart from his tolerance? I thought the tolerance was impromptu."

"Soon after I realized you had read the note, I trained myself as a sophisticated urban guy with deep pockets, aiming to intimidate, please, and persuade you."

"Are you saying your character persuaded her for the movie?"

"I think he did a pretty good job there. What do you think?"

"Of course he did. These sophisticated people with deep pockets have a knack for intimidating and gaslighting others. Pity the lives of women like my character, married to such men. Sooner or later, they’ll feel very sad realizing that they never had their own wishes or dreams—all were planted by these men. Vulnerability. I thought you were playing a politician—you were diplomatic and had a lot of tolerance most of the time."

He picked up a bitter gourd and spoke into it, waving his hand periodically like a robot imitating a politician. He made exaggerated, animated faces of a contemporary politician. She watched these faces closely, trying to identify who he was mimicking. When she finally recognized the politician, she burst into laughter, and he joined in, halting his act.

They sat around the dining table, thankful their dinner hadn't turned out to be unpalatable. As he took a bite, he mumbled through a mouthful, "I might have to rely on you for tonight's role. I want to decide whether to go ahead with the one I have in mind based on yours."

After chewing and swallowing her food, she responded, "Well, what is it? Honestly, I want to blend two roles, but I’m leaning towards just one. Since you’ve already depended on my naive, pleasing character once, I’d like to hear about yours first."

"Fair enough! I’m thinking of playing a guy who got inspired by crime movies and pulled off a successful bank heist."

"Wow, that guy’s going to champion movies like a true believer. I’m curious how he’ll defend your argument that life in a smaller town is better than in bigger cities."

"Honestly, I have no idea. Since you said you’d argue against movies to make your point, I figured I’d use him as a shield until you wore yourself out."

"Not a bad plan."

He watched her, waiting for a response. She closed her eyes tightly, pressing her fingers against the bridge of her nose as she thought. "Sorry, I got carried away. I don’t think I have any idea how to make that point right now. I might try to break through your wall, but I’m not sure I’ll even make a dent. Anyway, I’m playing a theatre critic in disguise as a dumb girl dressed up for a party. With the movie running for about two hours, I’m hoping this character can pierce through your wall of defence. I’m confident."

"Why would you reveal the disguise? I'm curious."

"The play critic can't always be right. When she's wrong, she’d feel bad, and I don't want her to waste time dealing with those consequences. So, I'd rather let her blame the dumb girl dressed for the pub for the errors. She needs a few trial-and-error opportunities, and the dumb girl is her excuse."

"That's an impressive one. I can already see you framing me there."

"What do you think are the odds?"

It was a midsummer night, and he carried an umbrella with him. They visited an ice cream parlour. He wore jeans and a half-sleeve checkered shirt in a light-coloured palette of white, light orange, and a hint of olive. A black cap sat atop his head, complementing his clean-shaven face with a thick moustache. She wore a flowing black mini A-line dress with a studded sweetheart neckline. Delicate diamond studs, elegant stilettos, and a touch of red lipstick added to her elegance. He opened the door, and the delightful scent that wafted through the parlour couldn't stop him from turning around after noticing that all the tables had been taken. She held his hand and said, 'It's ice cream; it melts. We will find a table soon.'

The waiter approached their table, handed them menus, and walked away to attend to other guests. Without glancing at the menu, he called out, "I’d like to have a vanilla." She, on the other hand, perused the list, reading through the descriptions and studying the colourful pictures of the ice creams.

"Are you stuck between too many options?" he teased.

She didn’t reply. Leaning forward, he asked in a low voice, "Are you looking for an opportunity to forecast?"

"Yes! Indeed I am," she confirmed.

"I’m curious, what’s the idea this time?" he asked.

She took a moment to detach herself from the menu, looking up to meet his eyes. "I’ve selected something, and I believe they won’t have it."

"What is it?" he asked instinctively.

"You’ll see. If it’s not available, then I win," she said confidently.

"And if it is available, then I win," he affirmed.

"Well, I’ll have to try hard. Sometimes it doesn’t rain even when the forecast says it will," she mused.

"Alright, I’m all ears," he said, signalling the waiter to come over. The waiter nodded in acknowledgment.

"But did you decide on what you actually want to have?" he asked.

"Yes, and I’m sure it exists," she laughed.

"So if it doesn’t exist, you would lose?" he teased.

"Technically, I should win because I would have guessed two non-existent things."

"But you intended the second one to exist," he pointed out.

"Yes," she agreed reluctantly. "Alright, I would lose if it didn’t exist."

The waiter approached their table, "One vanilla and one little berry," she announced.

"Sorry, ma’am, the little berry is not available," the waiter informed her.

She wanted to scream in victory but instead glanced down at the menu, then around the parlour, observing couples, families, and elderly duos all enjoying their treats. The lively chatter of their conversations tempered her excitement. She turned to the waiter, who stood by their table with his pen poised, not wanting to draw attention with an outburst, "Add one kaju kismiss," she requested.

After a brief pause, the waiter apologized again. "I’m sorry, madam."

Puzzled, she glanced at him, her earlier excitement mirrored in his face.

"Is it out of stock?" she asked hurriedly.

"Make it two vanilla," she decided quickly.

The waiter walked away with their order. "The weight of excitement just evaporated," she remarked, surprised.

"So did my fear. So, are you going to lose?" he chuckled.

"Well, I won the first one, lost the second... that leaves us at 50-50 again. Now I’ll have to try harder. I should’ve looked around and picked something others were having, or at least vanilla."

The waiter returned with their order, and she inquired, "Why was kaju kismiss not available?"

"People weren’t preferring it these days, and we had instances of large quantities being left over," the waiter explained.

"Oh, thank you," she replied. "Enjoy your ice cream before it melts," the waiter said, greeting them before walking away.

They savoured their ice cream, letting it melt gently in their warm mouths.

Another couple entered the parlour. The man, noticing them, approached their table with a puzzled look on his face, leaving his wife behind. He walked steadily, his expression shifting between curiosity and confusion as he drew closer.

As the stranger approached their table he quickly recognized him, stood up and greeted him with a hug.. "I thought it was you, but your hat kept throwing me off," the stranger admitted, relieved.

"Yeah! How have you been?" they exchanged pleasantries and introduced their wives.

They engaged in a lively conversation about their lives. She noticed the stranger's wife seemed uncomfortable, fidgeting with the zip of her handbag. The stranger noticed the umbrella and excitedly asked, "Oh, an umbrella! Which movie have you watched?"

"We haven't yet. We are about to," he replied.

"Do you remember the movie we sneaked off to as kids, and you brought your school umbrella? It was a memorable experience. Ever since, you've carried an umbrella for luck," his friend reminisced.

"Yes, those were the good old days," he smiled.

"I always admired your commitment to your superstitions."

Glancing at her, he noticed that their conversation had made the stranger's wife uncomfortable and had also melted his ice cream. They silently agreed to leave the table to them and decided to move on.

"Alright! We should get going. We're running late for the movie. It was nice catching up with you!" they bid farewell and left.

They walked down the street with empty ice cream cups in hand. Tossing them into a public bin at the corner, they crossed the road. She held his hand as they crossed, asking, "Which movie was it? the first one you took an umbrella to?"

"It was an old movie. It wasn't the first time I carried it, but I made it look like a superstition to everyone due to a lack of convincing words. Once, after a movie, it started pouring rain. I had lost myself in the movie, forgetting about exams, homework, games, everything. It was a surreal experience. I wanted to walk into that rain, into the pool of water outside the theatre, but I was stopped. Someday, I want to relive that nostalgia... You see, movies can transport you to another world."

"Wait, I feel like you're patronizing me. That's what movies are supposed to do, but I also think you shouldn't be bored in that world," she teased.

He remained silent, the air filled with a tense silence.

"I'm sorry if I overstepped. Your story just got me into my character," she apologized.

"No worries. We were almost near time to step into our characters," he reassured her.

Pulling out their wristwatches from their pocket and handbag, they wished each other a fun time and entered the theatre compound.

They walked into the theatre compound, bustling with people of all ages. A mother and father were consoling their crying toddler, two siblings were fighting discreetly away from their parents, a group of friends were laughing loudly, another couple held hands just like them, and an old couple tried to organize their belongings. Amidst all the notices on the walls, one particularly caught his attention: "Beware of pickpockets." She moved towards the movie posters to get a closer look.

He warned her, "Be careful, there are pickpockets around."

She turned back and said, "Coming from you, it sounds ironic," and walked towards the posters.

He was the most conscious person in the compound, or at least he tried to be. He quickly began to identify potential robbery targets: the box office, the vehicle parking counter, and the canteen. He forced his thoughts and ideas to formulate plans to rob each of those targets. His meticulous planning was disturbed by people brushing past him. He smiled at them and tried to resume his planning, struggling to pick up where he left off. Eventually, he concluded that robbing any of the three targets would likely result in getting caught. He thought, for a desperate man with robbery as his only way out, he should consider jumping the compound wall from the backside to escape and the box office is the only reward worth the risk of climbing and jumping the tall compound wall.

The movie poster depicted a steam engine running along the countryside, but it emitted yellow pamphlets instead of smoke. A few teens gathered around, trying to figure out what the poster was about. She, without hesitation, meddled in their conversation and said, "This poster is a metaphor to say the teens travelled on trains distributing pamphlets."

She moved to another poster, a silhouette of four teens sitting on top of the train, each on a different compartment, and no two of them looking in the same direction. She felt disappointed that the poster was giving away the main theme.

People started moving inside the theatre hall, and she returned to him. They walked with the crowd towards the entrance. Two men, with physiques like bouncers, stood there checking tickets. Though he had tickets, he successfully walked in without showing them.

"This place deserves a robbery; it would be easy. The robber could simply walk through the gate; he doesn't have to jump the wall. At least then the management will be a bit more stringent in checking tickets. There is no tension or a sense of it while walking through the checkpoint without tickets," he expressed his disappointment.

"These people are just presenting the idea that only people with tickets will be allowed inside. They need not be perfect I think", she replied.

"If that's the case, a notice would have been sufficient. The bouncers are put there for a purpose. They took away all the thrill. That's what we robbers crave for more than the loot."

"Well, nobody is perfect!" she calmed him down.

"Some Like It Hot by Billy Wilder. Look how much thrill the characters in disguises in that movie experience."

"Well, I haven't seen that movie."

"You should. It's fun. I will gift you the VCD."

"Movies are not my taste. They bore me with their predictability."

"I see."

"I prefer plays over movies. You are the one who steered the car from going to the pub to here."

"Why is that preference?"

She didn't have an answer. "Have you seen any plays?"

"Movies are my thing. No, I haven't seen any."

"We should go to a play once."

Slowly, they walked into the darkness, guided to their seats by a torch. They settled in and were presented with things not to do while at the theatre.

The title card "It's Unpublished, Yet!" appeared, inspired by the article "It's Unpublished Yet!"

The woman whispered into the man's ear, "They're publishing it with the title 'It's Unpublished Yet!' Irony! These days it has become a common trend to be ironic. The irony is predictable and not funny anymore. It makes me think and laugh before it's too late but always falls short."

"The manuscript is still not published; they haven't found the author. The title refers to that. I think it is an apt title."

"It is, but I believe, it is the irony in the title that got the makers excited to use it as the title. It's clearly visible."

He tried to respond, but the movie began.

Five teens are playing roller hockey as a team. The goalkeeper is the eldest of them. Two of them are brothers with an age difference of two years, and the other two are the same age as the eldest sibling. They are all friends from the neighbourhood. They are a soft and sensitive bunch; they give up at the risk of falling down or getting hit, and they are so compassionate that they don't even have to come up with excuses for their mistakes, as all five understand the cost of falling down, getting injured or being hit. They all decide to go on a vacation. The goalkeeper is in search of a new team and refuses to join them on vacation. The siblings work at their dad's factory, and of the other two, one acts as an arbitrator at the local chess club, and the other works at a local library to earn some extra money for the vacation. They make an itinerary of the places to visit, and a song plays with a montage of the places they visit and they tick them off their checklist.

"Quite a boring vacation, don't you think so! No surprise, no thrill, in fact, nothing," she said sardonically.

He was of the same opinion, no thrill or adventure like he in the attire of a retired robber craved for, everything went as per plan but he had to defend himself,  "They are kids. Going alone on such a trip is challenging and adventurous in itself. Look at their meticulous planning..."

The teens on the screen are unhappy with their vacation, but they all keep their feelings to themselves.

"You see they are unhappy too, I told you! It will be predictable .", she triumphantly said.

"They pictured the vacation montage in such a way that we as the audience feel that boredom. That is the way they chose to make us identify with those characters. There is nothing to predict; it is clearly visible."

"You think so? Come on, that is to build up their motivation to go on a journey to find the author after they find the manuscript."

"That's the problem with knowing things beforehand"

"Not my problem, it is a true story the maker should have considered the information that the audience is aware of while designing the experience."

On their return train journey, they find a manuscript. They look around, asking whom it belongs to, and when one guy tries to claim it as his and steal it, they catch his lie. They find this as an opportunity to make their vacation memorable, and they decide to go on a journey to find the author.

He anticipated so loudly that after the previous scene, there would be a revelation that each of the four had secretly wished that they shouldn't find the author on this train, but that has never been addressed on the screen and he is disappointed.

She goes to his ear and murmurs, "Look, these kids are going to stick pamphlets at every station and ensure those pamphlets travel to every village just like a newspaper reaches..." She became critical of her thoughts and continued, "That's brute force and tedious. There is not a thing adventurous about it?"

"Well, it may be tedious. They are just a bunch of kids who could easily resign from what they have embarked on."

"Then there would be no movie. Also, I think you should stop addressing them as kids. If they can easily resign then I bet they are going to learn not to give up on this journey, and play a match in the end and win it."

"Let's see." He resentfully said.

Their return train is delayed. The librarian-teen picks up the manuscript and occupies himself with it. The other three playing freestyle football with a soft drink tin formulate a plan, to make pamphlets and stick them at the local library in the next station, after many disagreements. The late-night train drops them at the next station in the early hours. As they wait for the sun to rise, the elder sibling tired of thinking through this hopeless journey says, "Let’s give it to the station master and drop back home." The librarian-teen reading the manuscript is not aligned with the idea of going back, while the other two, undecided, remain silent. The elder sibling, after not getting any response that he had expected from them, snickers and says that he was just joking. They visit the library and luckily find an elderly person who comes to inspect the library, waiting for it to be opened. After they pitch their idea, he supports them by giving an authorization/order and 1000 copies of pamphlets to stick the pamphlet in every library or town centre.

"I don't think this ever happened in reality," she expressed her dissatisfaction.

 "What?"

"The library inspector authorizing them. How convenient of the writer to place the inspection officer coincidentally to move the story forward quickly. This is disappointing."

He is disappointed that there is no conflict or a situation that challenges the teens so that the compassionate audience could have invested their thoughts and come up with a solution for the teens on the screen. He remains speechless.

They visit the bus stop, pass the order and pamphlet to the bus driver, and ask him to leave one at every stop and get it stuck.

"Wow, that's another hit. It's predictable and boring, just like the lives of many people in this theatre who live in this small town."

He cannot disagree, he decided to change the way he watched the movie and he tried it without any idea of that way.

A stranger tells the four teens that there is a village which won't receive a newspaper and suggests they go to that village themselves. The elder sibling, maintaining the tour finances, starts to worry about the available funds for the rest of the trip but hesitates to mention it.

After visiting the island village by travelling on a boat, the librarian-teen says he finds the village to be similar to the one mentioned in the manuscript. He tries to convince the other three with the few other similarities, but they say they can't risk the chance of not finding him. They agree to meet exactly after three days and pick an early morning train back home. The librarian goes in search of finding the author in the town. The other three wave goodbye to him and continue their journey. The three of them rush to the railway station to catch a train and are just in time to catch the train to the next station.

The movie reaches to interval and the lights turn on, he turns to her and she sighs "Ahh! The story should have followed the lonely teen at least, instead, they chose to follow the three teens. There is nothing new in this path. They are going to think of returning which they cannot because they can't leave the fourth guy. They are left with the only option of finishing their job and catching up with him 3 days later. I am pretty sure in this gap they are going to reach the threshold to going home, quarrels start to happen among them, and they will lose communication among themselves, which can lead them to lose each other and for a happy ending they find each other after realizing their mistakes, and to be noted they are going to emerge victorious in their next roller hockey game as I said". "By the way how did you like the movie?

"I liked a few moments, them playing football with the tin. You remember the scene where they were dissatisfied with their vacation but after finding the manuscript they go in search of the author on the train. Deep inside I wanted to see each of them wishing that they shouldn't get to find the author on the train. There were many such instances where I anticipated something and the result fell short."

She considered the movie had bored him too and shrugged her shoulders.

They rose and walked out of the theatre along with the crowd, she followed him as he had a peek out through the window, the wind blew but there was no sign of any rain. He stood in the queue, to buy snacks and drinks for the next half, and she joined beside him and she began to feel sympathetic for him and the lady in disguise took over the critic in her and talked through her and they came to a consensus to feels sorry for him. She compassionately said, "Do not worry! It's okay, the scene where you wished to see their intentions while looking for the author,  that cannot be changed in this recorded medium, now you have missed an expectation."

"Thanks for feeling for me. Maybe I was imagining my mischievous self at that age, also it's not gonna change anything, but a little suspicion in the background music could have directed my experience that way".

"True! and nothing is going to change, as I have told you movies are made for a perceived expectation of the crowd.  You may have the most interesting expectation in the room, and you could anticipate it to happen, the makers might have thought about it too. But they won't have enough data to support them to say this new scene works. Look at the diverse age group of the crowd, not all of them are mischievous the normalized expectation here would be just they won't find the author on the train. They wouldn't risk experimenting with it. They just try to meet the normalized expectation which works out according to the data."

The man began to comprehend this quite tiresomely. She continued
"I have similar expectations in life, my expectation is never considered in this town- I have to restrict my expectation to a normalized expectation in this town. All these new businesses selling products or providing services, come up only in the big cities because there is a reasonably good volume of crowd expecting it. They take time to come to our town- not all of them come to our town only the successful ones. Even in that case, they have to train us, the public prior. Creating an expectation before launching it. I came to believe that all my expectations were manufactured by someone, none of them were manufactured by me. It all becomes vicarious. I sometimes wonder whether it's my expectation or the one that these people trained me along with every one of us."

They arrive at the snack vendor "two coke and two popcorn"
He collected his order and they walked back to their seats.

She exemplified,  "We were told that it is a custom to eat popcorn in theatres and I blindly eat it and I happen to like it. But there must have been a time when a group wanted to have popcorn in the theater and someone might have allowed them to have and when the result was positive. The Westerners have created an expectation of it and we all bought it. I never had a wish to have it in the first place."

"True! I cannot agree more, you know after the story went exactly in the direction you said and after experiencing nothing but the disappointment of having anticipated something and having got something mediocre I have decided to retire with the idea of anticipating as I retired from robberies. I would want to just sit and relax, and consume everything I see and listen and mould myself to make sense out of it and finally want to see what it transforms me into"

"Sounds like an interesting Idea" She suspected some kind of foul play in his resignment but her suspicion was not of a good intensity as his resignment was justified. "I might want to try it too".

"I would like to have some compassion for them and be sensitive towards the film."

She embraces the idea, pursuing her lips tightly she nods her head.

They started eating their popcorn sipping off their soda cans as the slides flashed and the movie resumed. The three teens kept travelling station after station and from each station to the bus stop and handed over the pamphlets to the bus drivers, sometimes they had to wait for a few busses to arrive from the round-trip. All three feel and want to quit it and catch the next train back home but having left the fourth guy with a promise to meet in 3 days they struggle within themselves to overcome that thought.

She stopped her critical words as they came out and transformed them "Poor guys what have they signed up for, they needn't have signed up for this"

He smiled at her words without saying anything back and his smile was never visible to her in that darkness. But deep inside she knew she didn't mean those words. She was trying and it was difficult for her.

The teens have planned their sleep mostly in trains but with the crowd in trains, they took a hotel. The hotel people duped them to pay more than they had dealt with. Slowly their pockets start to get empty. They slept on the railway platform. They are having food in limited rations. The arbitrator started to blame the elder sibling who had been managing the finances from the beginning of the trip is being kind towards his brother with the food rations.

In the central station with less than 24 hours left to catch the train back home, the younger sibling gets frustrated for being the cause of the fight takes a few copies and goes away early in the morning.

The frame freezes over the arbitrator fighting the cold and sleeping curled up on one side with his legs and arms pulled close to his body, and slowly the frame tilts over to the elder brother sleeping,  leaning his back to a wall and with hands over the luggage by his side. Cut to a wide top shot revealing the two sleeping on the railway platform among a huge crowd, which pans over to the younger sibling walking out of the station.

He noticed her tense expression, her eyebrows drawn up towards the centre of her forehead, lips pressed together in distress. She uttered quietly, "Go back!" Her tone and the look in her eyes made it clear that she empathized deeply with them at that moment.

The other two wake up and look around for him. The elder brother walks towards the arbitrator and holds him by the shirt and the arbitrator hits him back and they both start fighting.

"Don't fight! look out for him" she cries helplessly

The public stares at them fight until one elderly man interjects and stops the fight.

"Thank god!" She exclaims.

With an elderly man in between they say what had happened and the elder brother reveals that it is his food that he gave to his brother. Arbitrator apologizes.

"Look at the pamphlets, he took away few" The film critic is completely subdued by her disguise and turns completely naive and childish.

The arbitrator notices that a few papers are missing and the list of libraries in the city is half torn. They deduce he might have gone to those libraries. They rise and they go out to visit those libraries. With the clock ticking they reach back to the station to find their brother.

Having successfully delivered pamphlets to all the libraries, they believed it was only a matter of time before the author of the manuscript reached out to them. With that confidence, they boarded the train, ready for the next step in their plan.

As the train started to move, they settled in for the journey, but as the hours passed and the station where the fourth member was supposed to board drew near, a sense of unease began to creep in.

When the train finally arrived at the station, they scanned the platform eagerly, but there was no sign of him. Concerned, the elder sibling quickly got off the train and rushed to the entrance, searching desperately for any hint of his arrival. After a frantic search, he found nothing—no familiar face in the crowd, no message, nothing. Disheartened, he hurried back to the train, hoping they hadn’t missed something.


“What do you think? Maybe the fourth guy already left for home,” he suggested, his tone carrying a hint of intimidation.

“Don’t even think about it. I might curse you if one of the characters gets that idea,” she shot back, rejecting his suggestion outright.

He sighed in relief, realizing she was still invested in the story, and left her to continue watching the movie.

As the train continued its journey, guilt started to gnaw at them for leaving him behind. Soon, worry set in, and they decided that at the next station, they would get off and head to the village to find him.

“They’re not as cold-hearted as you to think of such an idea,” she said impulsively, her words carrying an edge.

The train slowed as it approached the next station, and the trio quickly gathered their luggage and stepped onto the platform. The train had received the green signal and was ready to depart. Just as it began to move, the younger sibling spotted a familiar figure at the far end of the platform, near the entrance—the librarian-teen was sprinting toward the station, followed closely by the boat driver carrying his bag. Before the sibling could react, the librarian-teen shouted with all his might, "Get back on the train!" urging them to reboard before it was too late.

She claps in excitement and her claps are echoed by a few others in the audience.

The train ascends into the sky with the sun gently rising.

"Do you want them to win the roller hockey game now" he tried to influence her thoughts.

"Yes of course"

They are playing roller hockey the teen who was looking for a team change is still keeping for them. The youngest of all scores a goal sparking jubilant celebrations among the team.

Her smile reflects the joy of their victory.

They arrive at the librarian's house and review the register containing the log of calls from people claiming the book but are unable to answer the questions correctly. Just as they are about to leave, they receive another call. They ask the usual questions, and this time, the caller answers them correctly.

Inspired by the article `It's unpublished yet!` the photograph of the article is presented on the screen.

"The book never came out, right?" she said to him enveloped in her seat resisting to get up.

"In truth, No they haven't found the author."

End credits roll! People get up and walk as they both wait in their chairs until the rush has been cleared.

"It reminded me of our football days when we were taken out to another town by our school of course we lost that's another story- The inclination to quarrel it is true," The man said to her

She replied "All it takes is an attitude to forgive and it is beautiful ever after"

The crowd gets clogged at the door and doesn't move. They both made their way through the crowd and she elated in excitement- "It is raining!"

She unwrapped the umbrella and they both walked out under it while raindrops pitter-pattered on it to the other side of the road under the shade.

She walked into the pool of water with the umbrella and jumped with joy.
"I completely forgot we had an umbrella", she exclaimed.
He took out the camera from her handbag and clicked a snap of her embracing the rain allowing it to hit her face and hugging the sky with arms stretched out wide with one arm holding the umbrella away from her, as it showered on her face.

Afterwards, they took an auto home. She looked into her handbag for the keys.
"I cannot find the keys I think I lost them" she panicked.

He pulled the keys from his pocket and said with a grin, "I stole them when I was in character."

As she opened the door,  "You know, robbers watch movies to understand the psyche of the audience and the limits of the mob so they can be sure of what they're capable of."

She playfully hit him.

Back at home, with the lights turned off, she said, "I think I too have transcended like you... this experience is surreal."
Not hearing a response from him, she said, "Good night!" and settled down to sleep.


They took an auto home. She looked into her handbag for the keys.

He takes out keys from his pocket, "I stole them when I was in the character", "You know robbers watch movies to understand the psyche of the audience, the limits of the mob, so when they go for a robbery they can be sure of what they are capable of."

She hits him playfully and they both laugh.

In the quiet of the night, with the lights turned off, she murmured sleepily, "I think I too have transcended like you... this experience is surreal."

She didn't hear a response from him, and with a soft sigh, she said, "Good night!" and nestled into her pillow. As she drifted off to sleep, he, deep in slumber, spoke faintly, "Yeah... movies... characters... unforgettable..."

She smiled at his mumbled words, feeling content as she gathered herself to sleep.

#             An irrational fear had sprung him out of his meditative state to consciousness. He hadn't opened his eyes yet, he tried to handle that fear by reciting the wise words his wife had said to him last night after he woke her up unable to handle the anxiety.
#         "It is okay to feel scared about the result of the play, with the first two plays having left a feeling of dissatisfaction".
#     "Don't give much of a thought to the outcome and the excitements associated with it"
# "Just stay with the things that are in your control"
# While reciting them he checked the presence of the anxiety in him, he found it but didn't acknowledge it. He couldn't comfort himself with those words for long. He felt deceived that those wise words didn't have the same effect as they had last night. He tried to keep his spirits up, imagining the consequences of the success of the play. It made him feel confident and thought that he had been in a meditative state for a long time and expecting everyone to have risen from their states open his eyes and only to his surprise he found all the players and crew were still in their meditation. He raises and walks up to the coach who is supervising them while surfing through the script papers. The Coach was the earlier Playmaker. Gardening, writing, reading, nothing could keep him away from boredom after retirement. He visited the theatre again, players and the crew felt encouraged with his presence and availability around. As the Playmaker got closer to the Coach, he became reflective about himself and all the inflated confidence fell short of his record, he quickly realized it and inflated it further ignoring his wife's words not to fantasize too much about the outcome.

# The coach kept the script aside and welcomed the pensive-looking Playmaker into his company and waited for the players and the crew to rise from their meditative state and allow them to talk.
# The youngest of the players and the crew began to arise from their meditation making loud noise and making others rise of theirs.
# Coach muffled in this noise to the Playmaker, "Both versions of the script look intact, we should stick to them"
# The Playmaker extended his ears to him with a pre-meditative idea of rejecting whatever the coach was going to say, "I cannot hear you"
# Coach cleared his throat and increased his volume, "I was saying, both versions look great, let's stick to one of the versions"
# "Why do you suggest so? From ages, all our plays involved the audience into the play."
# "Yes. I am worried about the impact of its result on you. I want you to keep it simple and have your fair share of satisfaction for your work."
# "I understand, thank you for your concern. But I am confident we are going to pull it off this time and get past that point smoothly."
# The Playmaker was not sure, he was shaken from the inside and his trembling hands reflected it.
# "It doesn't seem so. Are you sure?"
# "If you are speaking to me with my past two plays in mind. I tried. Not everything is in my control. I am learning. I am confident about this play, it can smoothly involve the audience."
# Before the coach could speak the playmaker challenged him, "You wanna take a bet for your fish."
# He absorbed the Playmaker's blustering swagger and remained silent.
# One of the crew members rushed hurriedly towards the Playmaker and informed him that the sample audience group was ready for the narration.
# The Playmaker rose and paused to accept the wishes from the Coach. As he walked towards the group he realized that the smile on the coach's face, while wishing, wasn't complementing his wishes and that smile on his face resembled a mockery stating that he won't be able to achieve it in this play as well. It bothered him and it started to make him angry he tried to make peace with his anger, but he had reached the group of audience waiting for him. He walked into them and they formed a semicircle around him. The group involved people of diverse age groups. Having a glance at them, he took a heavy breath.

# "Alright! Here we all are for the ritual before every play. ohh I see a few new kids today. Welcome!. Here is what we do, I will be narrating you a story and will stop the narration after a point and you will be watching a play and getting the rest of the story through the acts of the play. If you want to leave, feel free to leave now but not in between. Most importantly stay back after the play, we want to hear from you."

# `Four teens are in search of the author of the nameless manuscript that they have found on their train journey. Searching for the author they visited our village. While they were travelling on the boat one of the four started to spot similarities between the place mentioned in the manuscript and our village. By the time they reached the bank of our village, crossing the river, the teen was confident that the author was from our village. His confidence doubled when he found out that the boat driver's name is the same as the last name of the hero from the manuscript.`

# "Did our boat driver write a book?" queried a curious kid from the group.
# Other keen listeners gasped at this interruption, this had been a worry to them every time a new kid joined them for a narration.
# "Who knows? I don't know?" the Playmaker currently in the shoes of the narrator blurted
# "Didn't you write the play based on what happened?" the curious kid asked warily.
# Others from the group sighed in disappointment and exclaimed.
# "This kid is ruining the experience"
# "No question while listening."
# "Travel with your doubts till the end of the play?"
# "They will be answered."
# This kept the curious kid on the spot and made him uncomfortable. The narrator noticed it and he lifted his arms upwards and flapped his palms towards the ground. Repeating this gesture, he suppressed the heat of the crowd.
# "Well it's okay with him being a first-timer, but all of your queries would be answered by the end of the play." He made the kid feel comfortable.

# `Moving on... the teen who had a hunch that the author is from our village spoke to them about the similarities he had found with the other three friends, as they walked towards our town centre. They listened to him, they asked him questions about how he was so sure that the author was from this village. He answered them and when he felt they were convinced he proposed an idea to stay back and look for the author in this town. The other three denied the proposal bluntly saying that they could take the risk of not finding the author in another town by spending all their time in this village. They have struck a pamphlet saying they are looking for the author of the lost manuscript and walk back towards the boat leaving the curious teen there with a plan that they would be catching the early morning train exactly two days from now.`

# `On the river bank our boat driver noticed only three of them had returned, he gathered the whereabouts of the 4th teen and asked his friend to row them to the other side and hurried towards the town centre. `

# `At the town centre the teen was alone with his backpack, he went on asking everyone, showing them the manuscript, if they had written it or if anyone they knew could have possibly written it. All he got in return as replies were hysterical laughs which meant nothing less than "No one from this village could have ever written a book like this". The boat driver ran towards him and bent down panting for breath. Between his breaths, he uttered that he went looking for him all around the town centre.`

# `The teen being an outsider, our boat driver told him about the complication with the food and shelter in our village and took him to his house. Along the way, he inquired the teen roughly with whom he had spoken about the book and what had each one of them told him. The teen noticed a tinge of anxiety in the boat driver while asking him the questions and also found him to be relieved when he discovered that the teen hadn't got any leads on who the author was. Though this made the boat driver  his only suspect, he didn't have any hypothesis for why the boat driver would deny writing it, and it left him pondering?`
# `At home, while having dinner, the teen asked him many questions that arose in him while reading the manuscript, about how come such a town exists managing their social need and slowly steered towards if they ever travelled out of the village and how they felt about it when they come back. Our boat driver went at length answering that question but the teen uninterested in the answer waited for him to finish to ask him the most relevant question which "When was the last time you went out of the town, to which the boat driver answered it's been a long time". The teen wished it was a lie, yet he asked him "When you went out of the village did you travel in trains or busses? Do you like travelling in trains". The teen looked for any exhibits of nervousness or tension on the boat driver's face in the form of sweat, or avoiding eye contact and he found a few to his satisfaction.
# `

# `Next morning the boat driver insisted on staying with the teen and followed him to the village centre. The boat driver amused himself at the plight of the teen, who after realizing that none of the people, gathered around the pamphlet, stuck to the tree's trunk could actually read it, had to stretch his mouth, to let them know what was written on it to everyone who had their curious eyes on it. Our Boat driver saved the teen some pain by, pointing out folks who seemed to have no chance of knowing the author. The boat driver himself informed the fellow villagers about the contents of the pamphlet and queried if they knew anyone who could have possibly written the manuscript. `

# `Tired but without any luck he along with the boart driver reached home in the evening for dinner. The teen couldn't sleep that whole night, he couldn't think of any other plan to find the author. Worried, he goes through the manuscript in hope of some idea, late in the night. A squeaking noise caused a tremble in him it was the cupboard door. He opened the cupboard to fix the sound, and all the things from the cupboard fell down. The cupboard was overfilled. The teen looked around and checked if the noise had woken the boat driver up. He began to place one thing after the other back inside the cupboard. He found a book among them. The boat driver can write that's what he thought after going through the text written in the book. The teen is not sure if that was the boat driver's writing. If asked the boat driver would deny it as his, he thought when the opportunity came he would ask it stealthily. It exemplified his hypothesis why does one hide their ability to read and write?  and how can one abandon the book they have so much time to finish? Yet no reasoning suited his satisfaction.`
# `He went through the manuscript, and he identified a couple of characters with characteristics from the manuscript that had similarities with the characters he met during the day. He found an idea that soon formulated into a plan. He extracted all the primary characters and their characteristics and his gut told him one of them is either the author or knows the author. As we went through the extracted list of characters, he had a quick recollection that the boat driver, that morning, had prevented one of the villagers from reaching him, saying that he was not one of the probable. This made him confident that it was the boat driver and that character knew it was the boat driver. The next morning he asked the boat driver to take him to the list of characters and start with that one character who was prevented from reaching him. The boat driver, as expected by the teen, tried to prevent the teen from speaking to him but the teen insisted. The teen also spilt some tea on one of the papers and pretending to be busy, requested the boat driver to fill it up, the boat driver for a moment picked up the pen beside him but quickly and smartly, as the teen felt, avoided it by saying I know him and I know where he would be currently.`

# `They visited each and every one and came back home by evening with futile results. But during a visit with one of the characters, the character and the boat driver had gone into a conversation to which the teen was all ears. They spoke about the boat driver's recent visit to the town exactly the day on which they found the manuscript. The teen did not raise any questions but the boat driver's denial of going out on a train only gave him more information to believe that it is the boat driver who is the author of the manuscript. The boat driver must have realized the contradictory information he had shared with the teen and that character and tried to convince the teen saying he was just lying to the character as the character wanted him to take him out sometime. But the teen discarded it as a lie. The teen had some hypothermia that may be not everything that could be rationally explained just like their journey in search of the author. If they were to be rational they should have left the manuscript at the station master and continued their journey back home.`

# `While having lunch with the boat driver he found the boat driver to be very kind to him and the teen considered it as a sign of guilt for lying and the teen thought by being more honest to him the boat driver himself out of unbearable guilt might tell the truth. The teen expressed his melancholy that he is not hopeful despite his efforts and mentioned that he had to leave by the next morning he asked the boat driver for a means to reciprocate for all the privileges he enjoyed in the village. The boat felt sorry for him and suggested the teen teach map curation at their Montessori. That afternoon after their lunch the teen visited the Montessori and taught the kids there.`

# "We end our story here, thank you"
# "Well did our boat driver tell him that he is the author?" the kid from the audience group asked impulsively without any hesitation.
# All the members of the audience, "shh!"
# "Now we will be watching the remaining story in the form of a play."
# "Enjoy the play"
# The Playmaker turned back and climbed up the stairs beside the curtain. The curtain rose slowly. The set resembled a waiting room between the entrance and the Principal's room. Four kids of the teen's age are waiting each with a paper in their hands under the supervision of their teacher who was preventing them from having a conversation. These kids however gesture to each other not to be scared showing the papers in their hands. Soon they came up with more ways to communicate among themselves only for the sake of irritating the teacher.
# One of the four was very stern and looked obedient, he didn't move an inch he seemed to be scared of what might happen to them, he was reciting something. He didn't participate in the communication that teased the teacher. He frequently looked at his paper and began to get nervous.

# The director was seated beside the coach watching the performance from the side view. The coach captivated by the performance of the obedient kid said "he is nailing it". The director, looked at the coach with trepidation  "Do you really know what is happening there, I am afraid he might ruin the play. No doubt he is acting really good and that's what is going to ruin the play. He had captivated and drawn all the attention of the crowd, but by now the crowd should be and would be rooting for the teen to find the author and with no other way around and with limited time for him before leaving the place they would be wanting him to confront the boat driver. His act will make them forget all of it.".
# The director's cue called the character to walk out from the principal's cabin. The player playing the teen was behind the prop door, which was being held by a person hidden from the audience's view. The character playing the teen walked out and the other guys pulled the door slowly at an angle, giving an effect of it being closed by the wind. He, upon noticing the four under the supervision of the professor asked
# "What happened?"
# the three of them said equivocally, "They suspected us of spreading a rumour"
# "a rumour?"
# "some silly one to laugh at and not a serious one to feel sad about. but this guy... you know we even apologized to him"
# pointing at the papers "Are these apologies?"
# "Nah, we were asked to write the rumour as we have heard it and they want to know who created it based on how much we know from what we wrote  and matching them against others"
# It seemed to have struck some idea in him, "You mean you told it to one of these two and one of them told it to another and it spread..." "Yes kind of but they traced it to us as the root"
# "Have they reached the correct root?"
# "it's for them to deduce, fairly good so far"
# "good luck then"
# "Sure! See you tomorrow"
# "I'll be leaving early in the morning, I may not see you"
# "did you find the author?"
# He remained silent
# "you should try some ideas of our principal"
# The four exited the stage walking into a door with the title - Principal.
# The curtain dropped the set was quickly set up for the principal's cabinet and the curtain raised.
# Inside the Principal's cabinet, the four gathered around him and the school bell rang, all of them had their attention towards the windows and the principal was the first among them but the teacher got all of them back to the situation they were dealing with. With the help of the teacher, the Principal read their writings, "This guy seems to have created the rumour because his version pretends to be the least upgraded and it also to an extent has the roots of the rumour in it. Principal looked at him and the kid responded that he did not do it." Peon knocked on the door with a word from the principal's wife, "Madam has arrived and is waiting for you", and he was deported with the message that he would be joining her soon. The principal looks at all four and the teacher, three of them except the obedient kid are happy that the principal is going to leave and they would be relieved. The obedient kid uncharacteristically joins them. The Principal says he has some work and the wife says please, he asks the professor to put it on him and suspend him and warn the other three.

# The teen player visited the boat driver in the morning as he was about to leave. They spoke of the things that make them feel lighter and while the train leaves the teen player asks the boat driver if he had missed to say something and he says 'NO'. "I am sorry if I had given you the impression that I am the author."

# As soon as the play was over a few of them stayed back clapping while the others inclined to leave, left. "Thank you all, See you at the play in the evening" the director called out as they left.

# The director couldn't face the elderly man as their eyes met. He went straight to the kid, who played the obedient kid in the play. He was along with his fellow players changing back to normal from the rehearsal costumes and enjoying the praise from them. The Playmaker walked in and shouted, "How do you think you performed?"  The obedient lad didn't turn back, feeling for that person, he continued to stuff his bags, he was quite sure that anger wasn't directed towards him. For a long moment, there was no reply and he had to turn back with his unbuttoned shirt flying around. He was panic-struck when he noticed the Playmaker, with his hands folded, staring at him in rage. He looked around embracing the embarrassment, and everyone kept themselves occupied with their things like he kept himself busy with packing his bags  "How dare you steal the show?"
# "I didn't, I was just..."
# "you were just...? you weren't providing cues to anyone"
# "when someone comes up with a great idea, your act undermined it instead of toying with it"
# "you know what? you are selfish and you don't suit this theatre"
# "I am not selfish" Selfish is one of those tags one hated being called in that village, where everyone shared everything.
# "You are and you better get to terms with it"
# He felt he might be looked down and tears started rolling down his eyes, he resorted back to his bag and he removed everything from the bag and started to stuff it again. Other players left after they had changed and packed their stuff, a few of them pat on his back. He was angry with the playmaker as an actor and with this debut in a few hours, he didn't want to entertain the anger but he was not able to control it he began to hate himself with that anger. He badly wanted to be beside his friend. She is the person who had helped him many times in such situations, he always cried his pain to her and she would soothed him. He is not on talking terms with her. He hated himself for fighting with her. Suddenly he felt helpless and began to hate himself more than the Playmaker. He had to convince himself by giving himself hope that he would go meet her, apologize to her and become friends with her.
# The coach walked in and the lad tried to hide his sorrow. "you still around, I almost locked it"
# The lad said "About to leave"
# The coach noticed quavering in the lad's voice and walked up to him and the lad's eyes revealed that he was crying.
# "what happened"
# "Nothing"
# "you can save those lies and drama for the stage, now tell me what hurt you"
# After a long fight with holding back his tears, he cried "He called me selfish" and sobs.
# "oh man cmon, never mind, you played the character you were given. He must have called that character selfish, that character is supposed to be selfish fearing for himself. You did a great job acting that role, you even pulled off the meticulous details."
# The lad tries to clear the tears on his face.
#  "You know what? therein lay the very problem, it drew the attention of the crowd. It is not your fault you are supposed to draw the audience's attention and hold them captive as you did, but only when we are performing a classic. But in this play, your role's objective is to present what the crowd is anticipating, we would gather cues from your act and with that information we decide which climax to play in favour of audience expectation."
# The lad remains silent without uttering a word with his head dropped down and his elbows resting on the thighs.
# The coach waited for him to say something, "Did you get it?" "Say yes, say no"
# The kid feebly said "yes".
# Coach rubbed on the kid's back
# "You know when I was around your age,  to be an actor was the only dream but couldn't get the act right I was terribly bashed. I felt really bad and thought that would add complications to my getting the act right. The more I thought the more worse my feelings became. I have decided to spend the day alone, with the activity I like until the playtime. I went out fishing, I let the bait in and was wandering when suddenly a fish caught the bait, soon another and soon another and by the end of the day I caught 29 fish. I was elated in joy and I came to perform No thought about what had happened during that morning came across, I went on to the stage with lots of confidence and I was very satisfied with myself when the audience clapped. My teacher clapped too on my exit. All I want to say is forget about it and think of something that brings you joy".  The lad felt lighter after listening to this. But the idea that put him on this path of feeling lighter, to meet and apologize to her, has become a courageous pursuit.
# "Sure," he said to the Coach.
# The lad gathered his things and exited the auditorium. He found his wild pet dog waiting for him. He rushed to it and cleared the dust on it.
# He followed behind the dog to home, he changed his course onto a small bridge over the river. The dog saw it and joyously entered that path and led him. They visited his friend's house but she wasn't there at the house. His pet took him around the places where she might be and he rushed behind it. They didn't find her at any of those places. Disappointed, they both travel back home, he served food to it as his mother served food to him.
# He with his pet went and met his friend on the river bank, adjacent to the forest and requested him for the boat. Leaving the pet on the river bank to play and warning not to go into the wild he rowed into the river and stuck his boat between the rocks.
# He baited the hook with a worm and cast it into the river. Minutes pass by, and his thoughts surround around his history and look for the instances where he was selfish. Not a single fish caught the bait but his thoughts caught the instances from his past that prove him to be selfish. The more he resisted the more clear the thoughts became where he denied having something though he had it when a friend asked him. He made peace with himself that he would say sorry to him but an excuse followed, would that make his friend think that he had gone crazy to say sorry for this small thing after years? No matter what I am gonna say sorry and never behave that way.
# He reeled in the line and checked the hook, only to find that the fish had cleaned off the bait without getting caught. Glancing at the sleeping pet he changed the bait and cast it into the river again. An hour passed by, and no fish took the bait, but his thoughts travelled to many such instances where he was selfish. Bothered by them and unable to find a resolution he continued to wait hoping for luck. During this time to keep himself pleasant he began to recollect the memories he shared with her. The moment they became friends after doing mischief at school, the fun they had at their family outing outside the village, and the way they became like-minded in having opinions about their village lifestyle. The gifts they exchanged for their birthdays. He felt the fishing rod to be heavy for a second as he steered it up it felt loose and he tried to resume back at the thought he was wandering about -- birthday- it was her birthday-- it reminded him of the instance that caused a rift between them both on that day she asked him to go with her around the scenic places of the village, but he refused her wish and went to play mud games with his other friends. He thought that it was his mistake, and suddenly a thought, if he was selfish in that instance occurred to him and his thought was read out loud to him in the playmaker's voice you were selfish, "had you refused it for acting it wouldn't have been selfish but you had refused it for your own pleasure of playing in the mud which you could have easily compromised on but you chose to compromise on her". He couldn't accept it and felt ashamed. He tried to make himself feel better by comparing himself with the guy who came from outside in search of the author in the matter of selfishness but soon refrained from comparing himself with an outsider who can purposefully act selfish. Time flew very slowly and it was painful for him. As the sun was about to set he gave up on catching the fish and rowed towards the bank. His pet on the riverbank is being intimidated by a hare, he calls out the pet not to get into a fight with it. The pet dog jumped at the hare and the hare ran into the woods. The pet chased it into the woods. He quickly jumped into the water near the bank pulled the boat to the bank tied it and rushed into the woods in search of his pet. He is scared about the life of the pet. He looked all around, he hated himself for listening to some silly advice and imitating it. He had tears rolling down his eyes, the play might have started already and he couldn't find his pet. He found himself in the most helpless situation ever. He had a choice to make whether to give up the play about which he is most passionate or give up the pet in the hope of it returning tomorrow morning. He decided to give up his debut and with determination went around looking for the pet. He found the pet taking a few steps behind to jump across a small stream of water. He called out loud for it and it looked behind.
# He rushed to play, across the streets of the village, with his pet behind him.

# As he arrived at the theatre he heard a huge laughter from the crowd and he had a peek at the stage, it was the comic scene where the teen is finding it difficult for food and shelter in their village without money. He rushed to the backstage, all the while feeling nervous about what might they say to him. He is surprised that the director didn't ask him anything about being late. He went to change his costume and noticed a new guy, his friend was in his role's costume, being attended by a make-up man. The coach was telling him what he needed to do. He walked up to the coach but the coach didn't pay him any attention. He gathered some courage and said "I'm sorry that I am late",
# "You don't have to be, but you have to postpone your debut, he will be playing your role today"
# "We still have time for my entrance"
# "not your entrance anymore, we promised him that he would be playing it"
# "I lost my pet in the woods and I was scared of it becoming prey to the wild, I went out for it"
# "well you had your priorities"
# "I cannot let it become a prey, I am lucky to be here. I would have been called selfish by you all had I left it there to become prey and came here to act."
# The coach sighed and asked "What do you want me to do now"
# "Ask the playmaker for my role back"
# "We already offered it to him, that would be impossible"
# "You didn't even try."
# "We already offered it to him"
# "Well one of us is going to be disappointed today,  I'll blame it all on you and your dumb fishing story. I was foolish to imitate your story hoping things would turn out like they did for you. I rather have lived it my way by finding her and spending time with her. Not even a single fish caught the hook."
# The coach took the fault on him and he walked to the backstage. The stage is being set for the scene where the teen discovers the boat driver can read and write. He found a moment of playmaker's time and said
# "He is back, and is ready to play"
# "yes I saw him, but we gave his role to another person"
# "I know, he had some genuine reason for not being here on time"
# For a brief moment, the playmaker didn't respond and the coach continued
# "ignoring his reasons and him being late for a moment. The risk of failure with an actor who hasn't rehearsed is higher. The new guy, forgetting about suggesting the information for the change of course of the play, may bomb his act. He hasn't rehearsed. The obedient kid can at least pull the role he is given. Who knows what effect the word you used had on him? He might even perform better."
# The playmaker pondered for a while and was called by the crew for some instructions. As he went there, the coach interrupted him, "What did you think"
# "I am not going to say it to the new guy"
# Coach with a smile of relief on his face said "Thank you"

# The Coach walked back to the two lads who were in anticipation and anxiety.
# "I need you for a moment", the coach called away the replacement kid who was feeling anxious.
# "I am sorry to say this, you won't be debuting today".
# The kid is disappointed on hearing this but he doesn't make any protest
# "You will be making a debut soon, I promise you."
# "I need to rush, I have to let my parents know that I am not playing."
# The kid rushed away as the obedient kid stared at him.

# Coach ordered the make-up man to make the lad for the character. As the make-up man applied make-up the lad sweated a lot and the make-up man asked him to relax and not think about anything. "I am trying but I cannot help it.". "don't try just stop it, what happened to all the valour that you exhibited a few minutes ago". He sweats more and "I will tell them to use that lad for the play if you sweat yourself". "I am scared after all this if I disappoint" He drinks some water and just gets his make-up done.
# Four kids of the teen's age are waiting each with a paper in their hands under the supervision of their teacher who was preventing them from having a conversation. These kids however gesture to each other not to be scared showing the papers in their hands. Soon they came up with more ways to communicate among themselves only for the sake of irritating the teacher.

# After the bad day, this lad couldn't recollect any of the expressions he had prepared. He managed to act based on the cues from his fellow actors and tried to irritate the teacher.
# The director on the backstage commented "he is neither stealing the show nor his existence is recognizable. Looks like he camouflaged into the background"
# The director's cue called the character to walk out from the principal's cabin. The player the teen was behind the prop door, which is being held by a person hidden from the audience's view. The character playing the teen walked out and the other guys pulled the door slowly at an angle, giving the effect of it being closed by the wind. He, upon noticing the four under the supervision of the professor asked
# "What happened?"
# the three of them said equivocally, "They suspected us of spreading a rumour"
# "a rumour?"
# "some silly one to laugh at and not a serious one to feel sad about. but this guy... you know we even apologized to him"
# pointing at the papers "Are these apologies?"
# "Nah, we were asked to write the rumour as we have heard it and they want to know who created it based on how much we know from what we wrote  and matching them against others"
# It seemed to have struck some idea in him, "You mean you told it to one of these two and one of them told it to another and it spread..." "Yes kind of but they traced it to us as the root"
# "Have they reached the correct root?"
# "it's for them to deduce, fairly good so far"
# "good luck then"
# "Sure! See you tomorrow"
# "I'll be leaving early in the morning, I may not see you"
# "did you find the author?"
# He remained silent
# "you should try some ideas of our principal"
# The four exited the stage walking into a door with the title - Principal.
# The curtain dropped the set was quickly set up for the principal's cabinet and the curtain was raised.
# Inside the Principal's cabinet, the four gathered around him and the school bell rang, all of them had their attention towards the windows and the principal was the first among them but the teacher got all of them back to the situation they were dealing with. With the help of the teacher, the Principal read their writings, "This guy seems to have created the rumour because his version pretends to be the least upgraded and it also to an extent has the roots of the rumour in it. Principal looked at him and the kid responded that he did not do it."
# "He didn't read them thoroughly equivocally"
# "Don't lie"

# Peon knocked on the door with a word from the principal's wife, "Madam has arrived and is waiting for you", and he was deported with the message that he would be joining her soon.
# The principal looks at all four and the teacher, three of them except the obedient kid are happy that the principal is going to leave and they would be relieved. The obedient kid uncharacteristically joins them.
# The principal turned to the next person's letter, "you going to skim it too?" said the lad
# Principal looked at him in shock, "Upon finding us guilty if you are intending to punish us, please read it thoroughly."
# The peon knocked on the door but the principal didn't signal him in. He went on reading through them marking them.

# The lights went dark and the Narrator narrated - "Having picked up an idea from the lads the teen looked for any secret that existed in the manuscript and found that the boat driver while rowing back his boat, flipped and someone rescued him from drowning. No one knew about it."
# The teen was at the river bank with the manuscript waiting for the boat driver. He arrived tied up his boat and sat beside him.
# "Did you share it with anyone?"
# "I shared with my girlfriend"
# "And do you have trust in her?"
# "She wouldn't share it with anyone"
# "How about the rescuer"
# "He may have"
# "Can I meet both of them"
# "Wait near the tree I will bring them there"

# The teen waited near the tree and the boat driver arrived with his girlfriend.
# "Have you told about this to anyone"
# "no"
# "How can I believe you?"
# "I wouldn't popularize my fiance with this kind of story, my parents would not offer me to him"
# Soon the rescuer arrived upon asked the same question to him
# "I am sorry I told it to the actor on the stage when I felt his performance would be better if he was provided with some inside info about the village so that when he becomes a part of his act would be considered as improvisation, but he stopped talking to me for sharing that."
# "did you share it with anyone else"
# "no"
# "Did anyone possibly overhear you guys"
# The rescuer said "I shared it with the actor in the water ambulance probably the medic overheard about it"

# They visited the play that evening, waited for the play to finish and found their way into the actor's chambers. The actor was in the middle of clearing his makeup. He took the teen away from everyone.
# He said that he had not written any book and he continued "Ever since I heard the story my act dominated other players' acts and that affected the play and I was not being given good roles.

# The clock ticked and he had a train to catch at 4 AM.
# The boat ambulance was nowhere to be seen.
# The boat driver helped him by rowing it to the ambulance and the medic in the ambulance said he had overheard it but he neither had time to write it nor had any interest in it to share it with anyone.

# They rushed to the other end of the river. The boat driver knocked on his friend's house. Collected the bike and they travelled to the railway station. With the fear of missing it at one stop, they headed to the next stop.
# They were alone in that station and were silent.
# The teen embracing his efforts
# "I guess this is the first time in my life I didn't give up, irrespective of the result. We play roller hockey back at home and I am the most scared one and often get injured. I always blamed myself for inducing the effect of giving up on my teammates. It has become a part of us, it made us lazy and luxurious. But when you said your name I found it to be the one mentioned in the book. I thought it was you, I wanted to know who it was. But deep inside I was scared and I wanted to hear from you. I am satisfied that I tried."
# The boat driver doesn't say a thing the train arrives and he boards the train.
# On parting boat driver says "I am sorry if I have given any sign that leads you to think it is me."

# The play ends
# All of them are happy, crowd whistles and claps.
# All the actors are called onto the stage and they bow down to the crowd and the director addresses the crowd. The obedient kid spotted his girlfriend in the crowd their eyes clocked and she responded with cheer to his smile.
# "Thank you! We have seen the most patient crowd today who didn't guide us in jumping to conclusions".
# They recognized at a distance in the crowd a tourist to the village clapping out of rhythm, quite appreciatively and the entire cast and crew's faces were filled up with smiles and satisfaction.

# The curtains rolled down and they exited the stage and the Playmaker patted on the obedient lad's back and said "Great job".

# The obedient kid walked to the crew and met the guy who didn't protest for the role and admitted to him
# "I am very sorry for creating false hopes and expectations in you and your family. It was very selfish of me to demand my role back. I am very grateful to you had you not given that chance I would have never realized my selfishness. While performing I came to realize what it means to be selfless. Thank you very much and please forgive me.".

#                 With trees alongside the road, the sound of the wind is loud. A whirring noise enters the space, gradually picks up intensity and occupies the entire space. The intensity is maintained, only for the time the sand stays at the neck of an hourglass and, gradually drops at the same pace, leaving the entire space again for the wind. The loose half-sleeve shirt of a 24-year-old boy, standing with his left arm extended and thumb popped out of his fists, flaps on his body soon after the whirring sound has reached its peak. 

#             He has been waiting there by the highway under the sun, in hope of a ride for quite some time. He was in a similar situation the day before yesterday but at a different location, where he wants to go now. Nothing more had changed, except earlier he was constantly fueled with excitement and energy, thinking about her and all the possibilities of sharing life with her. Now, every thought of her is putting him to work, to prevent demolition of the dream castles he had built, and draining his energy . He had forgotten that he hadn't eaten anything or drank water for a long time. 

#         He sees a car entering his horizon with a whirring sound; he extends his left arm and pops out his thumb. Only this time, the car doesn't reach its peak when it nears him. The car stops just after passing him, and an elderly man pops out of the window, turns back to him, and waves for him to get in. He picks up his backpack and rushes towards the car. As he gets into the car, the elderly man's wife, in the driving seat, greets him.

#     The sense of relief in finding the ride doesn't last long, overtaken just like a fast-moving car overtook their halted car while he got in. With his thoughts of hope about finding the ride put to rest and with the prevailing silence in the car, the noise in his head is bright, clear and precise. "I shouldn't have rushed..." "Why do I have to be so excited?" "Why did my parents pamper me so much as a child?" "why didn't my friends contain my excitement?" "I should have let her know who I am and, in fact, more about me.". "Who asks a stranger, 'Will you marry me?'" "and who will say yes to a stranger.".

# Each one of his regrets opened a new door, took him to the deepest of the depths until he absorbed ~self-hatred~ and popped him out at a new space, strange enough for him to be lost with in no time after taking a few steps, with questions "What would you do now? Would you still pursue all those goals of yours? Who would inspire you now? Does this life mean anything to you anymore?" and left him hopeless. As a kid he observed many men in their youth opening these doors and found them always to be sad and depressed; he firmly decided that he would not only never open them but will never even look for their keys. Today he came to know what the keys to those doors look like. Having unlocked a new area in his mental space, he experiences a tinge of excitement generated by the new horizons instead of the expected suffering. Puzzled by this strange feeling, he begins to suffocate and finds it difficult to breathe.

# Despite all this, there is something to feel happy about, a distraction—his thoughts now broken loose are no longer rational or sequential. He has no control over them; any thought can take control over him. Compassion for the girl has distracted him from thinking about himself and axing him further. It has taken over his other thoughts, presenting him with the realization of how uncomfortable he might have made her feel. What could she possibly be going through now?

# "Sit comfortably, isn't the bag on your lap heavy? keep it aside." the lady driving the car speaks looking into the rear-view mirror.

# He places the bag aside but still sits uncomfortably, as if he is in the crowded back seat of a car, trying to give everyone space.

# "sit back and relax," the elderly man says soothingly and passes him a bottle of water

# He finds it a lot of effort to think and reason about their courtesy, so he simply obliges. 'Thank you.'

# "what track were you listening to?"

# "No space in my bag. I had to hang the headphones over my neck. I wasn't listening. The last one I listened to was Rolling Stones"

# Finally, that was the response the elderly man expected. He reaches out to the dashboard, fetches the 'Rolling Stones' cassette holder, and queries eagerly, 'Same cover?'

# "Yes"

# "Do you have any other"

# He names two other cassettes that he has and the elderly man presents the one's he has from the dashboard draw.

# "Both Same covers?"

# "same covers, yes" the young lad responds feebly
# The elderly man sighs in disappointment.

# Having surrendered to an overwhelming state of emotion, the Young Lad is completely clueless about what is happening to him. A sense of futility creeps in, as though he had missed an opportunity to reciprocate their generosity. This feeling stays bright only for a tiny moment. During this fleeting moment, it furrows his brows, casts down his eyes, and turns the corners of his lips downward, sculpting a statue out of him and then hands over the control to the emotional state he is in.

# The elderly tentatively asks her lady, "Shall I play rolling stones again?"

# "Nooo...! I am already feeling nauseous about them..."

# "Okay, how about that game, now that we are three it might be fun..."

# "No... c'mon, two or three it's not fun "

# Noticing his face has been deflated by her words she ponders while driving and pleasingly utters "you know what, let's play."

# "That's Nice! Thank you! I'll start then"

# The lady interrupts his excitement "Let me tell the rules, I will start with a piece of story and after a point will pass it to you. and you will take it to another point from there and pass it to the next person. We will continue this until we reach the climax."

# The elderly man ignores the rules as he prepares to begin "Alright, I have got an idea, I am starting." 

# The lady objects "If you start you have to pass it to him, let him take the third turn. He will get an idea"

# "I can pass it to you" the elderly man protests

# "that becomes clockwise and we decided not to play this game clockwise"

# "Alright then, go ahead but no child protagonists"

# "ohh c'mon... okay!"

# The lady exclaims and continues to drive the car for a kilometer or so

# "Once upon a time, not very long ago there lived a beautiful girl. She likes to spend her days painting and reading books without worrying about anything. One day a boy in his youth watches her paint a landscape and when a paper flies away from the stack her pet fetches it. She thanks the pet and kisses the pet playfully. The boy couldn't roll his eyes away from her. He fell in love with her. Love at first sight!"

# The elderly man setting his cap right

# "The boy walks home and drifts into sleep thinking about her. All night he dreams about her. In the morning he wakes up to realize he is in a cage of family responsibilities."

# "it's your turn"

# The young lad couldn't resist imagining himself as that boy and the girl in the story as the girl whom he fell for. He kept discarding all thoughts and ideas that he felt might give away any information about him having loved a girl and currently facing rejection. He doesn't want the world to know about it. He pitied those in their youth when he was a kid. He knew what kind of impression they had left on him.

# The elderly man turns back and impatiently says "You cannot take so much time. Only starters get to take time"

# The young lad found himself immersed in the situation, overwhelmed by feelings of timidity, unworthiness, and inadequacy. He hesitated, caught in a dilemma about whether to speak, attributing his emotions to the character he portrayed, fearful of revealing anything about himself. With nothing to say, he struggled internally. Meanwhile, the elderly man had already turned back, locking eyes with him and softly brushing off his knuckles in anticipation. The lady's attention was fixed on the rear-view mirror rather than the road ahead. Before he could assure himself that he no longer identified with those traits of timidness, having overcome his timidity and bravely confessed his feelings to the girl he liked, words began to flow out of his mouth involuntarily. His thoughts and speech had achieved such synchronization that they flowed without requiring his conscious validation before speaking.

# "The boy was raised in a conservative family, where he was brought up very rigidly. He lacked confidence and felt timid about making a move to approach her."

# The lady is disappointed with the lack of any progress in the story

# "c'mon guys the girl cannot go to him, leave alone loving him back she didn't even see him or know who he is."

# She takes a breath. "One day, the boy sees the girl again from a distance. This time, she is laughing with a handsome guy and seems to be having a good time. She probably will marry him. The boy finds himself feeling very jealous and anxious."

# That was exactly how he felt in his situation. Not that he saw her laughing and having a good time with any guy, but he had the thought of her marrying someone. He had planned many ways to approach her, along with the one he picked, and got rejected.

# "He writes a letter of love to her but him being anxious about the outcome he doesn't give any hint that it is from him." the elderly man continues

# The young lad, in fact, had written a letter of love, but he hadn't chosen that route. He jogs his memory and sees it in his drawer where he had last left it, and feels excited to have written such a beautiful letter. As the elderly man turns back, committed to the idea that he was no longer that character anymore, the young lad continues the story with the plan he had devised involving the love letter.

# "He drops the letter anonymously into her paper stack. The girl reads the letter and is impressed with it. She starts her search for him." 

# "Power of a love letter!" exclaims the elderly man to the young lad's response.

# "You guys are too cowardly to imagine! You won't evolve, and neither does the story! You want the girl to find the needle in the haystack. I'm ending this. The girl thinks the letter is from the boy she was found laughing with and secretly asserts through his friends and acquaintances that it has been written by him. Her love for him swells, and she finally marries him."

# The elderly man rushes at her, objecting firmly, "That cannot happen. There is a flaw."

# A heavy vehicle, moving slowly doesn't give her way. She honks many times.

# "There is no flaw the story had ended"

# She realizes that waiting for the truck to give them the way is futile

# "Did he and his friends lie to her that he wrote it?"

#  She maneuvers the car off the road into the mud, bouncing everyone in their seats.

# "Yes, and years later, the couple fought about it, but it didn't last for more than an hour. That is the end."

# She accelerates on the bumpy road, overtakes the truck, and merges back onto the main road.

# The lady looks frustrated and her husband understands it and goes silent.

# The silence prevails for some distance and the lady herself breaks the silence.

# "You guys are just like that heavy truck."

# No one responds. They both remain silent.

# "The only difference is you make stories immobile," she continues, hoping to lighten the tension. When they remain unresponsive, she sighs.

# "I wish I could have told you sorry," she teases gently.

# "Alright, I am sorry, guys. Speak up, say something."

# "Apology accepted" elderly man responds though his tone is still stern.

# The lady looks into the rear-view mirror at the young-lad.

# "It's okay" the young lad responds, but he doesn't know what expression he is carrying.

# She takes a deep breath, trying to dispel the tension. "Okay then, I'll take it on me. I know I have disappointed your mood. Let me try to engage you for a while. Allow me to tell a story."!

# The elderly man, still looking a bit angry but softening slightly, responds, "Go ahead."

# "A few years ago. One fine evening, he returned home from a work trip"

# "Is it a true story?" queries the young lad

# "Yes it is", she didn't like the interruption

# "So... He walked into the house, didn't eat the sweet I prepared, didn't speak anything, didn't respond to anything, walked straight into his room and shut the door. I dunno if he cried but I waited outside the door with my receptors tuned to hear a cry. I think I heard something which he later denied. Checked if he is okay and he replied that he is but his voice didn't sound so."

# As she says that her eyes roll toward her husband and his eyes roll toward her but with her driving, they miss making the eye contact. 

# "Determined, and scared for him I woke him up and served him dinner, I watched over him till he finished his dinner, he didn't speak a word and later he went back to sleep. That whole night I couldn't sleep. I prayed for him to have the ability to get over it quickly. My thoughts wandered around a similar incident where I think he was as sad as he was that evening".

# "It was the day he proposed to me and the day I refused his proposal. I didn't directly know how sad he was that day, but the words I told him could have made anyone feel sad. He was likely sad all that night too, I think. I thought he might feel better tonight, at least having had a similar incident to relate to. But the night I refused his proposal, he didn't have any previous experience to cling to and think, 'This will pass too, like the last time.' I was concerned for him. Like I said, I was wandering over that past incident, maybe to find something that would give some hope that he would be relieved soon.

# He saw me at a classical dance event—well, I wasn't dancing; I was in the audience like him. He followed me to my house, but that day he did not have the courage to talk to me, so he went back to his city. He later told me that he couldn't stop thinking about me, and the more he thought about me, the more my image formed in his mind and made him anxious. He tried to avoid being anxious, and naturally, as days passed, the image started to fade. He got scared, and that's when he decided to be brave and travel out of the city to meet me. He did not start immediately. He was naive, timid, and lacked confidence. He set himself a few unrealistic goals, and maybe he thought if he accomplished them, I would accept him. To this day, I still feel that idea was superstitious."

# Something rang in the young guy's head; it rang as soon as the narration started, but when he heard about the rejection, the intensity and volume of the ring increased. He began to defend, saying, "What's superstitious about it?"

# The lady replied, exchanging a glance with her husband, and the young lad noticed it. "The activities he had set for himself had nothing to do with meeting me or requesting me to accept him into my life."

# The young lad thought he was still contemplating whether to protest, but the words came out, "But it gave him strength, confidence, and courage to meet you, didn't it?"

# The lady countered, "How is running daily related to gaining confidence to talk to me? Is he going to be talking to me about running?"

# The young guy immediately reckoned with his words because that was exactly what he did in his situation. He did those and many other superstitious activities to gain confidence before he went on to meet the girl he had seen a month ago on his vacation. Now, he was in the car after the rejection. A sense of doubt crept in, wondering how this lady knew what had happened with him, and it started to brew. The young lad ignored the suspicion, unaware that it was brewing, as he was busy recollecting how he had blamed himself for setting those unrealistic goals and going ahead to meet the girl without accomplishing them as he waited for the ride.

# The lady continued, "He came to my place and was nervous. He told me that he had seen me in the audience and very soon after, that he liked me very much and proposed to me. I had no such plans; I didn't care who he was and bluntly said no. In fact, I was rude, and I left. He followed me and told me that he never thought he would propose to anyone with the kind of personality he had, but it was his love for me that gave him that courage. I just looked at his eyes—they were already filled with the pain of rejection, but his face covered it with a tiny smile. But I didn't say anything back. I left, leaving him there. I thought I left, but I didn't realize I left with that image of his."

# “The young man thought to himself, ‘I’ve said that too. How old is my thought process, and are my ideas ancient? Even if their experiences mirror mine, the expression cannot be identical.’ He could imagine himself with the same expression after the rejection. ‘How did they know all this? Did my face reveal a similar expression when I boarded this car, and are they constructing the story to match that expression? There’s no chance they know it; are they reading my mind?’ He wanted to say, ‘Please do not read my mind.’ But he lacked any evidence that they were indeed reading his thoughts and not merely narrating their own story. He didn’t want to make a fool of himself. It hurts. ‘Do we share the same stories? They won’t believe me if I say so, and they might perceive me as pretentious.’ But how on earth do they know my story?” he cried out loud within himself, without making a sound. He was angry with them. ‘They shouldn’t be doing this. I have never witnessed such a phenomenon. How are they able to do it? Why can’t my mind stop thinking about the rejection? It’s very insulting to let others know that I was rejected. I have to stop thinking about it.’ He felt bullied, as if they were asserting their superiority over him. ‘They are the car owners; they don’t want a stranger to assert superiority in their car. Where is my head traveling?’"

# A signboard appears, and the husband reads aloud, “180 kms to **[destination]**.”

# At the serendipitous intersection of his own musing—where is my head traveling?—and the husband’s announcement, the young man exclaims and murmurs in exhaustion, “Again! You’re reading even this thought.”

# “Let’s take a halt; I’m feeling tired,” the husband suggests, and the young guy screams within himself, his frustration reaching a crescendo.

# As he steps out of the car and walks to a table with the couple, the young man’s mind races with queries and numerous hypotheses, attempting to justify how they seem to be pulling off this eerie narrative coincidence. Seated around the table, he is lost in himself, gathering the courage to question them without sounding stupid. He has to be roused by them to place his food order with the waiter. Finding it embarrassing and an opportunity lost to question them about how they are masquerading his story as their own, he is worried and takes a sip of water from a glass. As he sips, a strange childhood memory surfaces—a memory of when he won the quiz competition for his team back in class IX. The stakes were high: if they answered correctly, they would win by 5 points, but a wrong answer would mean losing the competition by 10 points. Passing would still result in a loss by 5 points. The question was, ‘When is World’s Human Rights Day?’ He didn’t know the answer, nor did his team, but as the clock ticked, he stood up and declared, ‘December 10th.’ His teammates pulled him down, scolding him—that’s when, after a brief moment of suspense, the quiz master awarded them 10 points. Though he lied to his teammates later, claiming he had read it in newspapers, he didn’t actually know the answer; it had just come to him.

# “He began to question how he had managed to answer correctly, but no answer came. ‘Was it an insinuation from someone who knew? Could it be telepathy, good karma, some cosmic energy, or did I somehow read the quiz master’s mind?’ Many theories presented themselves as possible explanations. It was a moment reminiscent of Helen Keller’s experience when she was accused of plagiarism, a story he knew well from ‘The Story of My Life’—the only book he had ever read, gifted to him by his mother for his birthday. He retraced his memory just as she had, searching for the source of his knowledge. ‘I am scared,’ he thought. No rationale seemed to fit what was happening to him. Had the rejection shattered his protective shell, ushering in a new phase? He felt exposed, as if the couple were stripping him bare. ‘Has it always been like this, and I’m only now realizing it? Or has something within me broken, making my thoughts visible for all to read? Can I ever return to the person I was before? I hate this.’ He searched for inspiring stories from his past to lift his spirits, but none seemed relevant to his current ordeal. He felt like he was unraveling. He screamed silently. The urge to cry was strong, but he held back, honoring a promise he had made to himself. After washing his face, he engaged in a disjointed self-dialogue, flipping each worrisome thought into a more convenient perspective. Suddenly, he was filled with an inexplicable energy and excitement. With that newfound resolve, he began to eat and reinforced the ideas that had emerged from this mental reorientation.”

# The young man re-entered the car alongside them, invigorated with a newfound energy, and they set off once more.

# “Well, a cheerful smile while tears rolled down his eyes—that’s the image I carried back home with me. Nothing bothered me until the point when all of this proposal business suddenly hit me,” she recounted.

# “She has some impressive memory,” the young man mused to himself, having expected her to need some time or a prompt to pick up where she left off. “As I closed my eyes, that image of his face appeared; it was just as it had been when it all ended. I rose quickly.”

# With a sense of resignation, the young man let his shoulders fall.

# “Like he knew where I could be found, I did not. The image of him kept visiting me; it started with naive innocence and later developed—or perhaps I fantasized it—into many such expressions, gauging his character and loving him more. I waited for him to reach out to me again. I knew he wouldn’t reach out to me directly after the way I rejected him. But at the classical event where he said he had seen me for the first time, he could come there to have a glance at me and still have a rational explanation for his presence. I made sure I was there every time there was an event; I had to attend for five weeks to catch a glimpse of him. As I set my eyes on him, he was already looking at me. All his fear had transformed into excitement within me. I rushed towards him, and he began to walk away. I drew close to him.”

# “That’s when I understood the depth of the impact I had on him that day—the loss of someone dearly loved,” she reflected.

# “And this is the night I saw him with that similar and intense feeling,” she concluded.

# Her story seeded a flicker of hope in the young man, yet it arrived at a precarious time. The nascent hope began to puncture the bubble he had meticulously crafted, turning every worrisome thought to his favor. With the shadow of doubt looming, he was resolute, exerting every effort to maintain the bubble’s integrity, to forestall its rupture and the potential dissolution of the tenuous serenity he had achieved.

# “For a moment, I wondered what would have happened to him if I had never met him again, but it was no time for ‘ifs’ and ‘buts.’ I met him, and we were both happy. He should be able to cling to this event and be hopeful.”

# The young lad’s hope fluctuated but was restored.

# They spotted a tall old man, seemingly older than all three, at a distance, signaling for a ride. The lady suggested, “I am thinking of stopping for him; you may have to take the backseat?”

# “I am fine with that; I wouldn’t mind,” he replied.

# They pulled over, and the old man climbed in with his travel bag, and together, they resumed their journey.

# “Let’s continue the story,” the husband prompted from the backseat, as if sensing the young man’s curiosity.

# “We’re in the middle of a story—I mean, I am telling them a story,” she clarified.

# “Do you want to listen?” she asked the old man.

# He remained silent, his face etched with confusion, but she took it as consent and proceeded.

# “Well, you haven’t missed much. One day, my husband came home, he is sad and depressed. His emotions so loud on his face, a sight from 20 years ago. It took me three days to coax out what had happened. Finally, he revealed that he had lost his most cherished possession—the manuscript of his novel. Though the idea had been with him for the past 23 years, he had never felt as close to it as he had in the last 7 years before its loss.”

# The young man, relieved that the story didn’t mirror his own, pondered the significance of the numbers ‘7’ and ‘23.’ His gaze drifted to the old man, whose head had drooped, and who turned towards the lady with a faint smile that failed to mask a hint of guilt. “Are they weaving him into their story now?” he wondered.

# The lady continued, “He kept all the pain to himself, never speaking out. I assumed he might be going through a lot of pain and would eventually get over it, but he never tried. He started to feel guilty.”

# The young man observed the old man’s reaction to the story and murmured, “This couple are serial readers.”

# The lady went on, “He blamed himself for his carelessness, for the useless values he had clung to, like not having written his name or address on the manuscript.”

# The old man appeared uncomfortable.

# The young lad’s thoughts raced investigatively. “What could be the old man’s story? Reading mine was simple because love is common, but not all are writers, and this old man doesn’t look like one. What could he have lost? What else could one have for 23 years and be close to for 7 years? That is the key. No doubt they are reading his story. A pet? No, not for 23 years. A loss, but what kind? Death? If so, who could it be? He is alone, probably his wife?” His imagination rushed to a graveyard. “That’s sensitive, even for me to think about. How are they doing it?” Frightened by the thoughts he was encountering, he put his deductions to rest and quickly caught up with the narration.

# “He couldn’t come out of it and resorted to alcohol to forget. I gave him time to realize that alcohol wouldn’t help but would only bring more and new problems. He soon started to blame his memory, which didn’t help him answer the question about how the book started. Soon after he lost his manuscript on the train, four kids who found it reached out to him, but when he claimed it as his, the kids expected an answer about how the book starts. Despite not being able to prove he was the author, he left an impression of a thief with them.”

# “His wife could have been sick, and he might have exhibited negligence in taking care of her. That’s why, burdened with guilt, he became an alcoholic. I am jumping to conclusions; I won’t approve of it. If I speak now, I will not only sound stupid but could hurt others’ feelings and sentiments.” The young lad hated his speculative deductions about the old man.

# “One day, I took it seriously, forced him to shower, groomed him, dressed him in new clothes, and dropped him at the library. I asked him not to drink that day to see the difference, I asked him to try. That day was hard for him, but towards the end, he found a pamphlet on the library’s lost and found notice board that read, ‘We have found a manuscript of a novel on the train. If you think it is yours, please call us.’ He dialed the number but couldn’t answer the questions posed to verify his authenticity. He started to believe he was losing his memory. To forget that he was losing his memory, he returned to drinking. The memory loss slowly started to become real for him. With him like that and me worrying for him, our home fell to nothing. I decided to take him to rehab, and he joined, but he couldn’t stay for more than a week. On one of my visits, he cried to be taken away. I felt sad and brought him home. I decided I would treat him myself with whatever he was facing, by showing a little more love.”

# The young lad’s mind was a whirlwind of thoughts and suspicions, each more unsettling than the last. He had told himself sternly, “Don’t mislead me, stop making noise,” as if scolding his own mind would silence the theories it spun about the old man. “He is guilty of his mistake. Do you know what mistake he made? His negligent behavior allowed him to give one medication for another. He overdosed her. He is guilty of it, and someone helped him with the rehab.”

# “That seemed to have worked, and here he is,” the lady concluded.

# The young lad yearned for confirmation—had she read out his story? The only way to know for sure was to see if she had read the old man’s story by matching his deductions.

# “I will get down here,” the old man announced.

# The lady pulled over the car slowly.

# “Thank you very much, you sound just like my daughter, though she is younger than you.”

# “You see, the daughter must have helped him overcome the grief,” the young lad thought, but that deduction wasn’t enough. He toyed with the idea of getting down there with the old man and was almost convinced to do so.

# The lady, pleased, suggested, “Let’s have a cup of coffee.”

# “Sure,” the old man agreed.

# They all disembarked. The young lad was now brimming with questions. He sought a private moment with the old man before rejoining the couple in the car. He insisted on carrying the old man’s bag into the coffee shop.

# Walking together behind the couple into the cafe, the young lad asked, “Where are you traveling from?”

# “My daughter’s house to my house,” the old man replied.

# The young lad probed further, “You must be attending some function of relatives?”

# “No, I have been staying at her place for the past three months. I kind of missed home, so I came.”

# “I can see that excitement. You’re not taking your wife and daughter with you?”

# “I have been living alone for the past 2 years after my wife passed away,” the old man revealed.

# The young lad’s curiosity intensified, but he tempered his excitement, realizing the sensitivity of the topic.

# “I am sorry,” he offered.

# “Thank you!” the old man responded, then lightened the mood, “Well, the disease needs to be sorry.”

# “Did she suffer long?” the young lad inquired.

# “She suffered for 7 years. I should have taken better care of her,” the old man confessed.

# The young lad, upon hearing ‘7 years,’ was eager to confirm if their marriage had lasted for 23 years. He carefully phrased his question to be respectful.

# “Well, I have gone through that phase, and it’s over now. I stay with my daughter; she takes care of me. I went into a depression like that fellow,” the old man said, pointing towards the elderly man.

# The young lad, driven by his deductions, was tempted to ask if the old man had accidentally overdosed his wife. Fearful that his thoughts might betray him, he cautiously asked, “If I may ask… How many years were you together in marriage?”

# “23, but I only understood her importance in those last 7 years of her suffering,” the old man answered.

# The young lad’s anxiety peaked, trembling at the thought that his hypothesis—that they were narrating the passengers’ stories as their own—might be true.

# “Please don’t mind me saying this, but I think you should be careful.”

# “Careful?! Did I do something wrong?”

# “No, you didn’t do anything wrong, but your past is vulnerable, just like mine.”

# “What do you mean?” the old man asked, puzzled.

# “She read out your story, substituting your loss with their loss of the book. It’s not fair.”

# “Did she?”

# “Yes, she did. She even mentioned the numbers 23 and 7, which were the exact years your marriage with your wife lasted and the years you were close to her. The couple are serial readers.”

# “Maybe it’s a coincidence.”

# “It can’t be a coincidence. The numbers 23 and 7 were accurate, and you were feeling guilty about…” He caught himself before he could finish the thought. After a pause, he continued, “Earlier, they told their love story, and it perfectly matched mine. Now yours matched too.”

# “Now that I think about it, I did wonder if they were talking about me during the part where he got addicted and went to rehab. But in my case, when I was in rehab, there were many people there with a past similar to mine.”

# “Maybe, but what if they never lost a book, nor were they in love? What if they’re just reading our minds?”

# The old man laughed cautiously. “At this age, I don’t think I would mind if they have read my mind or not. I have nothing to lose. It’s all in my head, and I am constantly dealing with it. The only thing I might worry about is some stranger getting to know about it. I’m not someone who hides from his mistakes. If I’ve done something wrong, I’d just tell them what I’ve told myself. Back in my adulthood, I too was worried about this phenomenon of people reading my mind and mocking my errors. I couldn’t handle it. I tried thinking loudly about random stuff so that they’d fall into the trap of reading them, if they were at all. I tried to see myself from an eagle’s eye view, considering the weather, the situation, the context, what I was wearing, what I was representing. I observed how my past influenced the decisions my friends and I made as a group. It takes a lot of energy, and it was difficult to always be situationally aware. I guess with time, I stopped worrying about that phenomenon and let myself go. Maybe I was a bit older than you are now, back then. If I have to think along the lines of your hypothesis, I see that the story was finished so quickly, almost exactly when we arrived at my drop-off location, because my mind was constantly thinking about how much distance was left. I’m visiting my home after a long time. Maybe she tuned into my thoughts of rush. Maybe that rush was part of the narration that led her to finish the story quickly, precisely at the location where I wanted to get down. To feel better about it, I adjusted or convinced myself to believe that it happens, no matter what.”

# “People do it for many reasons. In this context, it seems harmless. I saw nothing more than an attempt to make the listener feel better. But there are worse instances where they extract secrets and exercise superiority.”

# “I know not everyone wants to be open about their past, but be aware of the situation and try not to get lost.”

# They joined the couple for coffee. While having coffee, the young lad was unaware that he was sternly looking at the couple. He was worried, thinking about how dangerous this phenomenon could be, and he believed it was morally wrong to invade others’ privacy, no matter the context. He wanted to let the couple know this.

# They left the old man and started their journey. The young lad found some relief that the thought of the girl and the rejection hadn’t occurred to him for a long time. But soon, like the elderly man from the story his wife told, and as it once happened to him, he couldn’t form her image in his head and became worried. He tried to recollect the moment he first saw her, and the image slowly formed. As it formed, he didn’t feel much pain from the fact he got rejected.

# “Do you want to take the shotgun?”

# This brought the young lad back to his senses about what he needed to do. He wanted to let them know what they were doing was wrong, but he had nothing to back him up to say it. He tried to say it indirectly, if not directly.

# The young lad, still wary of confronting their morality, crafted an indirect question: “I have a question. Let’s say two people are having a duel. Would it be moral for one person to acquire all the powers of another and use them against that person?”

# Unaware of his disillusionment and proud of his subtlety, he observed their puzzled expressions, interpreting them as a sign that he had caught them off guard.

# “The last time I was as puzzled as I am now was when I turned on the wipers instead of the headlights,” one of them remarked, seemingly deflecting the question with humor.

# “Honestly, how can one gain the powers of another, let alone use them against the person?” they pondered.

# The young lad silently congratulated himself, thinking, “That’s how you trap someone with a question; they cannot escape now.” He felt each response tightened the trap.

# “You must have seen such scenarios in mythological movies,” he suggested.

# “I guess, but when one takes over the powers of another and uses them against the original owner, it demeans the fight between two superpowers,” they replied.

# His excitement peaked, hands trembling and voice quivering, “So you agree it’s bad?”

# “Good or bad, it kills the entertainment,” they responded.

# The young lad insisted, “Yes, it kills, and it’s bad.”

# He noticed his hands shaking uncontrollably and comforted himself, thinking this must be what courage feels like.

# They soon encountered a middle-aged man who appeared to be a reporter, based on his attire and demeanor. After he hopped into the front seat, the reporter immediately began transferring notes from a scribble pad to a notebook, drawing the silent attention of the others. The young lad, momentarily abandoning his moral stance, secretly hoped the couple would unsettle the reporter as they had done to him.

# Once the reporter finished his work, he apologized, “I’m sorry, I’m caught up in a very important thing.” He then asked if they had seen the movie “It’s Unpublished Yet!”

# “No, we don’t watch movies,” the lady replied, glancing at the young lad.

# “I was busy; I didn’t know a movie like that had come out,” the young lad added.

# “It’s based on a newspaper article I wrote,” the reporter revealed.

# They didn’t seem to have accepted his apology for being discourteous, and the idea to congratulate him didn’t cross their minds.

# The lady affirmed, “So, you are a reporter?”

# “Yes, I am. It’s about four kids who found a nameless manuscript on a train.”

# “They decide to find the author and give it to him,” all three, the young lad and the couple, said in chorus.

# “You people have seen the movie,” the reporter said playfully.

# “No, we haven’t.”

# “Then you must have read the article,” the reporter was now skeptical.

# “But it appeared in a newspaper with not many readers.”

# “No, we haven’t read it either.”

# “Then how come you know about it?” the reporter was unquestionably curious now, and the chorus continued mockingly and teasingly.

# “They get off the train and travel back, sticking it at every library,” the chorus continued.

# “Someone who read the article or watched the movie must have told you.”

# “No, you won’t be able to guess it. They ask questions to everyone who claims the manuscript as theirs.”

# “But how? I don’t know what’s happening here!” the reporter went fuzzy.

# The elderly man started, “Because I am the author of it, the one who lost it.”

# The reporter overlapped him, “Okay, come on now! You won’t be able to know this information which I am about to say because I myself just found out about it. They found the author; some lady called the kids up, and her answers matched 68%, so they decided to give it to her.”

# The lady turned her head and looked at her husband.

# “Now don’t say a thing. Ignore it like he did. Finally, the book is going to see the light of day,” the lady exclaimed.

# As the young lad observed, the old man struggled to stop himself from saying anything. “Yes, we don’t know,” the old man said happily.

# “I am sorry to have interrupted you. What were you saying?” the reporter asked the elderly man.

# “Forget about it. The book already took a long time to see the light; now we don’t want to block it any further.”

# “What do you mean, you don’t want to block it any further?”

# “Nothing,” the lady interjected, trying to distract the reporter from the topic. “He is talking about the book we wrote. It is based on how we journeyed through after he lost his dear thing.”

# “Do you write?”

# “Yes, we wrote it together,” that brought a smile to the elderly man’s face.

# “Look at how happy he and we are now.”

# The young lad thought he would have never let the book or something dear to one slip away so simply for seven years. He thought, “I would have tried at least. Is it so simple and easy to let go of something that is so dear to one?” and he started to think about the girl and questioned, “Will I be able to let go of my feelings for her so easily?” and answered it, “Maybe I can try if I want to.”

# “Can I read it?” the reporter asked the lady.

# “It is unpublished yet!”

# “Don’t lose it; not every child is as crazy as those four kids to get it back,” the reporter laughed.

# “We have taken care of it; we have our postal address and telephone number on it.”

# “Learned from our mistake,” said the elderly man.

# The lady quickly turned back to him and spoke to the reporter, distracting him from the puzzle he had gathered.

# “Give us your contact; we will post it to you once it’s done.”

# “That helps,” the reporter said.

# The reporter went into the bag and fetched a card, passing it to the lady. He felt some cassettes in his bag.

# “Do you guys want to listen to some music? I have a few cassettes,” the reporter offered.

# “What cassettes do you have?” the elderly man inquired.

# As the reporter named them, the elderly man sighed in relief. “Finally, someone is going to reintroduce us to some long-forgotten songs.”

# The young lad looked around; his stop was nearing. As the reporter played a cassette, the young lad became statue-still, enveloped by the music.

# The song began, and everyone joined in the lyrics except for the young lad. The elderly man beside him invited him to join the chorus, and the young lad hesitantly obliged. As they sang together, the young lad’s spirits lifted. Thoughts of her occasionally zoned him out, but he began to feel hopeful. Perhaps it was the couple’s story instilling hope, or maybe they were simply reflecting his own story back at him with added optimism. The old man, moving to the tune and humming loudly, tapped the young lad’s shoulder, encouraging him to groove along. The young lad rejoined the singing and dancing, enjoying the ride.

# “In two songs, we’ll reach my stop,” the young lad announced, continuing to hum.

# “Coffee time,” the couple chimed in, still humming.

# After the song, they stopped the music. The reporter mentioned he had to hurry, but the couple insisted he stay, and he acquiesced.

# They drank coffee and conversed. The lady found the coffee too hot to sip. “Don’t be nervous,” she said. “You reminded me of him 20 years ago when he first came to meet me. Are you like him? Do you have any such stories?”

# The young lad was surprised and relieved they hadn’t read his thoughts aloud.

# “I think I have one, but your story was great. I enjoyed it,” he said.

# “I guess each of you contributed to it. I was jumping onto all the new thoughts that sparked, only to make it engaging. I hope I didn’t offend you or come across as intrusive.”

# The young lad’s thoughts were pronounced, but he hesitated and refrained from mentioning them, instead saying, “It was a good time.”

# The young lad apologized for insisting to answer his duel question in his favor, and that got every one laughing.

# They wished each other well and parted ways.

# The young lad approached the elderly man. “What would you have done if she never looked back at you?”

# The elderly man replied, “I had already made up my mind to have one last glance at her face for my memory and then stop seeing her. But who knows? I might have lost myself as I did when I lost the manuscript. Without her by my side, I may have never found myself again. Now that I think about it, all it takes is a try.”

# A melancholic smile surfaced on the young lad’s face, and they waved goodbye.

# The car drove away, and the young lad walked down a lane from the highway. Thoughts of her and the rejection visited him, but they no longer bothered him. Surprisingly, he had attained a sense of objectivity over it.

# Humming the lyrics, he walked on the road flanked by trees, amidst the sound of the wind. The whirring sound of a car intensified and then slowly faded as he neared his home.
